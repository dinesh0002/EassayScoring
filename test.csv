0,1,1_315,"Curriculum has been adopted in many schools. This curriculum had a great impact on the developement of the children.But nowadays we see that the education institutions had tightened the curriculum system in such a manner that the children andyoung people arenot getting enough time to be indulged in other activities. Due to the strict and tightened rules the capacity of imagination and creativity isaffected badly.They become Book worm.A good curriculum is good for the children but apart from this same preference should be given to other activities.Following curriculum is necessary but education system have to understand the need of creativity and imagination role in a life of a person.There should a enough amount of curriculum should be prepared by the education systems that it will not affect the children and he or she will not feel the cumbersome of the theories.Due to the tightened curriculum thereb is no space left for the imagination and creativity. A creative mind is better than a mind full of notes and theories.Aenough space should be there for the development of the creativity in theminds of the children andyoung peoples.We all were aware of the saying thatcreativity leads to innovation.Educationplays a very vital role in the life of a person and it is that stage of life where a person grows and learn, if at that stage he or she will be engage by the theories and notes then it will going to affect their overall development. They may become mentally fit but the should not be able to delevop their thinking and creativity.So education system needs to losse the rope of curriculum and have to give equal preference to the other activities also.This will help children and young people toget enough time to increase their imagination power."
1,1,1_214,"I strongly agree with the statement ,  The tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room or imagination and creativityToday's education system is completely theory based. More focus is given on theory,text books and pre-defined things set. No room for practical things,experiments, innovation and creativity.Our education system is mainly rather completely pre-defined curriculum structure as to syllabus is concerned , then examination pattern, marking system is all decided by the respective state government. In each state curriculum followed is different and preset by our older generation/people. No new concepts are added , no innovative systems are created.Syallbus is changed once in every ten years, which is a long gap and in between various things are changing , the world around is changing rapidly but our education system is still lacking behind. Also our system in based on gradation which creates inferority among them.If you see in western part of the world, thier education system is completely based on innovation, imagination, creativity which creates and ehances the skills of the students thier.People their are more creative and have great imagination power as compared to our students. our students have a habit to work under a structure and in adisplined way since we have a tightly defined curriculum and it become a habit offollowing the same type of system furher ; when given the work which involves creativity we lack behind as compared to them.It allows us to thing in the same way i.e the traditional way of solving the problem nad not lateral thinking i.e looking at the problem in different angles."

4,1,1_201,"I will agree at some what extend, because if we think on regular basic of university of mumbai curriculam we didnt get time to do different things simelteneously with the study, study having lot of assignments, sheets, practicle even a theory,for that we have to come in the clg for 8 hours in travelling 2 hours wasted every day,9 hours went in the sleep,5 hour remaining in which we do our daily work, over an all the shedule is tight and we are not able to do creative things and for creation imagination is needed. this is one side of our lifeBut on other hand if we thought like in clg we have many practicle,events and also free time , in that free time regarding to the curriculum taking it as creation and make it more innovative and interesting as an project that will be awsome , it is tough to do but not an impossible , every work is hard but not imppossible. we can change in our daily shedule to give time for creativity and imagination. that would be more preferable and good for health if we do less laziness, sometime people take time to do this things but that is also fine because insted of just siitting free minded we atleast start to think and this think can make you the way for susscess.So taking both view in mind i think is depend on the everyone mentallity, and thinking power, if we think only about the passing and get job somewhere its fine , but it not make you active so far, so be active ,throw your laziness, take a part in every activity of clg , live every moment of life which will make you more creative by imagining the things. and one thing participation makes you imagine the things, and through imagination we can be creative."

6,1,1_276,"Education is very important in everybody life. As education makes the person capable and make a stand in the society. It gives knowledge, learning towards new things and make aware for towarad the society. As the education play a vital role in everybody's life so everyone should be educated.But if we talk about the education system, our education system is just like that the students having burdens of the study. The students not get enjoyed while studying. They feel that studies are boring and burden, part of their life. And our education system forces the student forthe studies. They are not self motivated for the studies. Our education system are not making the student capable and competent. Education System is like a mumerising the question and answers from thebook and writing the answers in the exam and just pass that. And from this they are not getting anything because after sometime student dont remember those things which they have written in the exam.The students are not creative andimaginations from their mind. Because the career of the students start with the mumerisingthe things from the school and ending learning from the college. And from this they are notcreative and explore bytheir own. Because our education system did not make them capable for creating the things. Our curriculum and tight schedule makes the student dull and follow theirstreeful schedule which student not able to think other than this.And thats why there should be change in the education system, so that student will not feel studies are burden and think beyond the curriculum of the studies and which develop the mind of the students so that they could think beyond this. Learning is not important but the creating something new is very important."
7,1,1_236,"I am disagree to this that the tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity. The education system of our country giving lots of oppurtunity to thestudents for mental and personality growth by providing proper lectures, focusing onextra co-curricular activities and etc.Imagination and creativity arises through our education system because the schedule or we can say the timetable which were followed by the school is good for student. The timetable consists not only the subject classes but also there are work experience, creative art, games, music and dance classes are also there where student can show their talent and enhance their skills. By these classes one can increase the power of imagination,creativity as well as knowledge. Education system seems to be tightly scheduled but actually it is not because if the student can not interact with different students or people then how he/she can imagine the new things. This system makes student to be responsible and honest towards on the work. The imagination and creativity is all depends on the person if student want then nothing is impossible.Education is the first part to give the right path to the people because knowledge and education makes the person to differentiate between the right and the wrong things.If one can make difference between the wrong and wright then it the way towards the good and positive imagination and creativity.The world is full of minds and every mind is different its depends on the person how he/she see the things. According to me theiris nothing which is right or wrong, the thing is that how we think and how we imagine, if we think that the tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity then definetly no one can find rooms for that. Many famous personality famous for their creativity and imagination and they are also the part of our education system. People like Narendra Modi who is the prime minister of our country whose eduaction is belong to this system only"
8,1,1_68,"The tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity.In my opinion i totally disageree with this. If strictness is not there nobody will want to study. Children want to enjoy there life more than study. You can not force someone to study if he dont want to study, if he want to something else.In a same way if the education system is tight does not mean that the person can not imagin or he can be creative. There are many students who are creative as well as good with studyes. Since the education in there school was strict. You have to be multitallented to be successful in life.Life is very big, Imagin if you are not good with studyes, you only have creative mind then also you can not compete in this world.Our education system focus on theoritical knowledge more than practical knowledge. And theoritical knowlege is quite tough than practical knowlege. That is why our education system is tough than outher education system. But it is the best. If you see in NASA most of the sciencetist are Indian only. Because of our good education system. Which is only possible because of tightly defined curriculum of our education system."
9,1,1_136,"NEED FOR IMAGINATION AND CREATIVITY IN CHILDREN                Education in the best way to know a person.But a education system in INDIA is to hectic or over loaded. The child has no time other to complete home work and assignments to even,remove time to play. The study is only book oriented and imagination is zero in childs mind. The initiatives are taken to develop this skills but due to over burden of bookish studies children have no interest in this activities. The tight cirriculum of studies should be reconsidered to help children in taking interest in creativity. Some compitetions should be held national wide by government to motivate children to take part and develop this skill properly.                 The schools should also take it as a challange to make children take interest in creativity and take this as a new cirriculum to make students take proper initiative in this and develop new things. This will help in new development of skill in person and help in development of india. The imagination and creativity will result in new invensions and development of new product in india itself and help in MAKE IN INDIA initivative. This will be done, if this is considered by national level. The reduction in syallabus will give the children an ample pf time to imagine and create a proper image. The parents should also help their child to make them imagine things. The stories of grannies used to help children imagine the things and develop imagination power but due to use of this mobiles and internet this have reduced as children only sees the vedios and understand. This should be stoped and make the children imagine the story by themselves .                 Children should take it as a task to implement it and develop this skill. Proper guidence should be also provided by schools and parents to help tkem imagine and create by apploding the creations made. this will motivate the child to do more such things and make it on a bigger scale also in furture..................."
10,1,1_189,"Important of curriculum of our educationThe term of curriculum refers to the lessons and acedemic content taugh in a school or in a specific course or program. In dictionaries, curriculum is often defined as the courses offered by a school, but it is rarely used in such general sense in schools. Depending on how broadly educators define or emoloyee the tarm, curriculum typically refers ti the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn, which include the learning standards or learning objectives they are expected to meet; the units and the lesson that teachers teach; the assignments and project given to students; the books,materials, videos,presentation, and readings used in a course; and the tests,assessments, and other methods used to evaluated student learning. An individualteachers's curriculum, for example, would be the specific learning standards, lesson, assignments, and materials used to organize and teach a particular course.In many cases, teachers develop theit own curricula, often refining and improving them over years, although it is also common for teachers to adapt lesson and syllabi created by other teachers, use curriculum templates and guides to structure their lessions and courses, or purchase prepackaged curricula from individuals and companies. In some cases, schools purchasecomprehensive, multigrade curriculum packages often in a particular subject area, such as mathematics.

11,1,1_327,"As we all know that there is unemployment in a huge rate in India , this is just because of improper facilty of education . Most of the schools and colleges belive in theoretical knowledge as there is no ppractical study in huge amount. So all this issues like students are goin to foriegn countries for higher studies and job because poor education facility in india.If we compare the students of india and those students who are in abroad then we will notice a huge change that is foriegners are much more active than indian in every field of studies . It is very much important to bring a good change which includes practical knowledge. In India students do not enjoy the way of teaching they are sitting on a particular place and their completion of their studies takes place this causes and amkes the child dull, as the proverb goes all work and no play , makes jack a dull boy. So as to make students active and to improve their interest in studies its very much important to put up their attention on other co-curricular activities and practical knowledge.For a change in Indian education more and more practical studies should be done , projector based studies should be there. The whole world should be used practically in their studies they should have the basic knowledge about the world, if it will be theoritical then the more amount of students will enjoy and the more will be placed in good companies which will help in reducing unemployment and it will reduce poverty rates . for a better india for an educated india its we who have to keep up our country and go with it in the progress of our country .For the good sake of our upcoming generations and our healthy india we must educate our students practically"
12,1,1_322,At Present time of india education systemis not well somany thongs that are done which is actually not required. All student and teachers are goes for the marksand percentage but that is not true for estimating the ability of any student. our countroy majorlly focus on percentage but demotivate to other which have not scored that much percentage so they were highly demotivated. And parents and teachers of student can tell them all time focus on the study. And they were not give opporunity to that person for proving inother field which he is excilent on that area. Teachers always want that their student done theirworkon time and all teacher give their workat same time so student how to give their best that mannar. Education system not work properly for so many reason not only this like corruption. In today's schools and college are do forthe business motive not for the motive of student carreir plan and grow their. In many college and school run as per businees motive which affect education system. At present education system run as business no one can say for excellence they were only focus on the moreand more percentage . We cab try focus to the strength of the student not for percentage .When we focus on strength of the student than student efficently workon that particular arear or feild . Wich helike most and he give 100% on that area. Today world no one can give suggestion that what we do for near near in correct manner. They school and college try give space to student and thinking upon him. This very required for every student and person . everyone has own capability and strength in that manner they were go ahead. So like that we change the pattern of the education system.
13,1,1_54,"There are no technolgy shortscuts to good education.For primary and secondery schools that are underperforming or limited in resourcees,efforts to improve education should focus almost exclusively on better teachers and stronger administrations.informations rechnology,if used at all,should be targeted for certain,specifix uses or limited to well-funded schools whose fundamentals are not question.To back these assertions,I'll draw on four different lines of evidance.1.The history of electronics technologies in schools is fraught with failures.2.Computers are no exception,and rigorus studdies show that itis incredibly diffivult to have positive educational impact with computers.3.Technology has a huge oppertunity cost in the more effective non-technology intervention.4.Many good school system excel without much technology.All of evidance stands on its own,but I will tie them togethre with a single theory that explains why technology is unabale to substitute for good teaching.Quality primary and secondery education is a multi year comitment whose single bottleneck is the sustaince motivation of the student of climv an intellectual Everest.Though children are natuarally curious, they nevertheless requir ongoing guidance and encouragement to persever in the ascent.Caring supervision from human teachers ,parents, mentor is the only know way of generating motivation for the hours of school years."
14,1,1_251,"Hold on! It is time to take a deep breath and look around the four walls of my confinement. Oh! I can&#039;t see any hues of joy or spectrum of love in it. All around me lies an enormous shroud of Macbeth, James Joyce, Einstein&#039;s theory of relativity, mole and its complex concept, scansion and so on. Where lies my story? Where lies the book cover personalized with my title? Every part of my soul yearns to take a joyous ride to the lush green grass of the lawn. Every song  remains incomplete without the company of my peers and family. Yet the deadly alive bell of my college warns me to abide by its currriculum. Its all about a fertile future not about the petty present.                                                      Today as I am jotting down my thoughts, the first thing that is coming to my mind is  what is the use of destroying and diminishing the present just because of an uncertain future? What is the use of such curriculum that prevents one from finding out one&#039;s hidden self? Creativity and imagination need time to penetrate through the hard shell of stressful curriculum. The imaginative and creative faculty of one&#039;s mind needs to be summoned and put into action to turn every realism into surrealism.                      A brush of Michaelangelo or a formula of Newton or a pen of Shakespeare cannot be accomodated in a stressful and relentless world of curriculum. It can only breed thousands of imitating and minds whose cretivity remains suppressed under the eavy books of pressure. Things are to reformed. Pressure is to be reduced. Let the minds feel free to wander all around the universe sitting on a mind of imagination creating, curating and caring thousands of fresh minds and soul.Let the talent within meet the talent without in a world lacking systematic stressful currriculum to produce some more EUREKA from someone&#039;s voice and some more pens of Rabindranathwiting about thecolours of childhood."

India is a developing country .The past of India was not good but the present of India is better then the past,and the future of India will be better then the present.So the Imagination of the people of India's was not more developed in the past but it is increases day by day very fast. Now there are produced new new technologies in India and it is increased. According to me it is right that the curriculum of our education is not suitable for imagination and creativity.Yes i am agree about this it is not better then the other countries.On the other hand if all the people of India tried about the education system than it can changed.

16,1,1_19,"Yes, i completely agree with the statement, that our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity. our education system is just based on theoritical knowledge, whereas in todays world with theoritical knowledge practical knowledge is also necessary for all so that whenever the person is going for a job he/she is able to understand the situation and work accordingly. If we talk about imagination and creativity there are few peoples only who thinks over it apart from their academics.But in recent years there has been number of changes in our education system, the narrowing focus of classroom teachers and lecturers particulary deal with the increase in workload and the curriculum.in todays world at every place creativity is necessary for all, if we are creative enough than only we can do the smart work. in many primary schools and colleges they basically focus on how the child is studying rather than on their curriculum activities, also our education system keep on changing earlier there was board for class 10 but they have done the cce pattern till 10th, and again it is being heard in the news that they will again start the 10th board. curriculum of our education is lacking behind in comparison to abroad, there many changes are being done but they are very well understood by them and in india there is no one who can exactly understand the education syastem . even the education minister of india is not aware about what should be done to change the system of our country,if we want to see changes and develop the habit f imagination and creativity in the sutdents than we should adopt many changes i"

18,1,1_295,"Education is a part of person's personality which makes them what they are to thAs education is neccesary, most of the children are being educatedbut some people believethat education leaves no space for imagination and creativity in a student's mind. This should not be the mindset of a person regarding education, instead, it enhances a student's mind and it'ssharpnessto understand things and make a use out of them in their lives and helps to survive with much ease. Education in return makes ones IQ higher than a uneducated person indeed. He/she understands how various things around him/her areworking and taking place on planet. The chemistry of natural processes, biology of living beingsetc.Along with this students gets to enhance and improve their creative skills from art, music and english litrature class. Art classes bring out the artist in them and make them search of their buried talent if they might be having. The poems which are taught to them takes there imagination and creativity to next level which an uneducated person won't have ever. Students not only learn from the education system about the working and running of the various factors, things and world but also they get to interect with other students and then learn from them new things and standards. Moreover a student gets enough time after school to do what he'she wants to of his/her own interest.Furthermore, education adds greater and more unique ideas in a student's mind and their works came out to be much beautiful and different. Education make them question everything which is because they have a different way of thinking and it is creative. Hence it should be believe that education makes children creative and more imaginative."
19,1,1_181,"In our education system needs one room for imagination and creativity because when we do not imagine any thing then how to create new thing. Rote learning still plagues our system, students study only to score marks in exams. Education system in India is falling because of more intrinsic reasons. There are systematic faults that do not let our demand for good education translate into a great education translate into a great marketplace with excellent education. Our education system rarely rewards what deserves highest acadamis. Risk taking is mocked. Our testing and making system need to be built to recognize original contribution, in form of creativity, problem solving, voluable original research and innovation. If we could do this successfully Indian education system would have changed. In our education system there is no part for imagination and creativity. Now a days creativity is very important beacause when we have only books knowledge we can not do new. Using books knowledge we only get a job. In our education system decide to leaves one lecture for imagination and creativity. This decision makes people creative. This is very beneficial for students. Now a days students only read core books and get good marks it is not sufficient. It is very important to thing about new thing. So in our education system should change. Boooks knowledge is only get the marks. When student thing about new thing with our imagination then our country developed easily. In other country education is based on pratical knowledge so in other company people minds is sharp in comaprision to our country.

20,1,1_63,"The tightly defined curriculum of our education sysytem leaves no room for imagination and creativity.well,according to me this statement somewhat reflects the harsh truth of current education sysytem.but I donot totally agree or disagree with this statement,as i think the opportunity for a student to outcast his/her talent in creative field somewhat depends on the college enironment and discipline rather than the curricullum of education system.since we know that the curriculum and different courses across different colleges in our country is more or less same. what makes a diiference is the efforts made by the college administration to create a room for imagination and creativity.for example there are various colleges in india that provide various extracurricullar activites,competitions and classes for encouraging creativeness of its students.there are various colleges that organise cultural fests,national level competition.students enrolled in such colleges get ample opportunities to show their creative side, beside their academic record.such students tend to learn new creative ideas and explore their own creativeness.they use their imagination and creativity to excel in such competiotions. so such colleges are there which provide ample opporunities in their education sysytem to ensure that their students performwellnot only in academics but also pursue their hobby and excel in other curriculum activity.on the other hand there are collges also which are very strict towards academic record of students.they ensure that students in their college indulge mostly in academics and course related studies.they do not allow their students to get involved in extra curricular activities as it will distract them from their studies. So it totally depend on what type of college you choose."
21,1,1_145,"It's interesting that people see creativity and critical thinking as being opposed. Its partly because people associate creativity with being totally free and unstructured in our education system.But what we really have to get hold of is the idea that you can't be creative.If you don't do something.you can be creative in math,science,music,dance,cuisine,teaching,running a family,or engineering.Because creativity is a process of having original ideas that have value.A big part of being creative is looking for new ways of doing things within whartever activity you are involved in.Ifyou area creative safe,for example,then your originality is going to be judged in terms of cuisine.There is no point applying the criteria of modern jazz to somebody who is trying to create a new souffle.A creative process may begin with a flash of a new idea or with hunch.it may just start as noodling around with a problem getting some fresh ideaalong the ways.It is a process not a single event and genuine creative processes involve critical thinking as well as imaginative thoughts and fresh ideas.But creativity is not just about coming up with new ideas;some ideas might be completely crazy and impractical.So an essential bit of every creative process is evaluation.If you are working on a mathematical problem,you are constantly evaluating,thinking,Does that feel right? If you are composing a piece on the piano,part of you is listening to what you are doing and thinking,Does that work? Is that going in a good direction?one is that it is about special people-that only a few people are really creative.Everybody has tremendous creative capacities.A policy for creativity in education needs to be about everybody,not just a few.The second misconception is that creativity is about special activities.people associate creativity with the arts only.I am a great advocate of the arts but creativity is really a function of everything we do.So education for creativity is about the whole curriculum,not just part of it."
22,1,1_15,"Yes, i strongly agree on the given statement that our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity.Now a days, in education system marks and percentage are considered as a means to consider one's ability and intelligence.Student just study for the sake of marks so that they can take admission in good colleges not for knowledge.Children are not imparted with practical knowledge,they are just given theoritical knowledge which leads to their failure in practical life.children are not exposed to practical experience/explosure to practical life which is very important for their future. no extraciricular activities are inserted as a part of education in education system.Just because of our education system student doesnot have that practical knowlegde of how to deal with companies in their interview.They are concerned about the events which are happening in the economy,they are just concerned about their bookish knowledge and marks.Our education system should be changed,they should encourage practical knowledge,extraciricular activities as a part of system.Students should be provided with environmental explosures and situations which will help them in their jobs.students should be given seminars for soft communication skills for their dealings with companies."
23,1,1_324,"As you know we live in a great country India. the education system in India is quite different from other foreign country.we should accept it that our educational is tight. i will not say it's bad but it is not as good as other country's education system. from childhood , we are learnt by our teacher or parent that you have to pass this exam. because of this a chid cannot create any idea in his mind. as we grow we do focus on our theory subjects . no one wants to involve in reseach field. there are no scope of research in india. education system of india is oldish type. they do not want to change it.after independence we have not given any invention to the world. this means not that we do not have mind or we do not have IQ . thisall because of our educational system . there are many reasons behind the bad educational system. the indian govt. do not issue enough fund for research program . because of this students are not able to do reseach work or any creativity .i think we canimproveour educational system . we have to change our system ftom theortical to practical . we have to change our present paper pettern . we have to add some creative things in our system. by doing these things we can bring a better future to our next generation . and we get something for world . we can give some great things to world."
24,1,1_126,"Now a days,studies in colleges and schools are going towards only for study. If a children havecreative mind then he/she will definetly good in study as well. Teachers and parentsshould aware students and their childrenabout others thing like sports, drawing etc. We always read a line DEAD FISH GO WITH THE FLOWbut we always follow this, there is more important things as studies in life.Lets take an example of last OLYMPICS, our country INDIA have won only 3 medels. There is a big reason behind it we always tell our child to be a good engineer or a doctor but never be a good player in swimming or football and in other fields. A small country like JAMAICA have more medels then INDIA not because they have only good skills but their mind has set from their childhood. Goverment also should support children in sports and other fields like drawing, fashion designing etc. Goverment should incease time in school and colleges for sports and things. As well colleges and school should enhance student skills in other fields not for formality. Tightly schedule of studies have increase dieases in children like diabetes and blood presure in early age. This is not a good thing for our suciety. Children shoould be free to imagine or create new things. Increase in rate of dieases in children have major problem in todays era. We are growing up day by day but we are forgetting this thing, it will be harmful for us in future. If a child is skillfull it will definetly good in studies as well. We should tell children to improve their skills from their childhood. Their should be an extra period in school to increase their development in sports and carriculum activites. This will decrease dieases and good skillfull children. In the last,A person with lots of knowledge have nothing if they dont have creative mind."
25,1,1_264,"Education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity. According to me this is nota true fact. If a person is interested in a particular thing and want to expose his talents he will automatically find space for it by his own.Now a day students have very tight schedule. They hve lot of things to do. They have to attain school, colleges, coachin classes, fitness centres. In institutions they are given lot of home works to do at home. They have assignments, lab internals, semestar exams school colleges competetions programs and much more things to do. So it's very tough for them to find time for their passion. Like a singer does not have any time to sing. A painter does not have any time to paint. A player cannot find time to play. A guitarist does not have time to play guitar. A swimmer swimming is whose passion hardly can swim. I am agreeing with all those things. But besides that i must say that if someone wants to do something there is no one who is going to stop him. One do not has to study throughout the whole year not even one studies. student like us studies only before the semestar. So if someone make aroutine that what he or she is going to do then i think easily by following the routine the person will find sometime in his tight schedule for his passion.So i am not disagreeing with the above topic but i can not completely agree with the topic too. I think it depends upon aperson that how much he or she is dedicated to his passion. If he wants to do something in his life with his passion he can easilydo that beside continuing his studies. So the fact varies from person to person that what will he choose."
26,1,1_168,"In today's world, education system has become more rigid, strictly following a tight curriculum. students,in earlier time , used to study for attaining knowledge and experience, but studies of this present era are only taking education just to take some qualifications in written . in earlier times, there was not that defined curriculum which is to be foolowed . students were that much creative and innovative and all the time, they came with new ideas and innovation .that time they were self-motivated and had passion for study. Nowa days, students are not that much creative. the one reason behind this is also the low level motivation &amp; the strict and rigid curriculum given to them. everytime, they got stuck in the trap of various assignments and homeworks given to them . they dont find time for doing something extra and creative . i believe that the whole fault lies with the education system .it should not be that much rigid and should also give scope to them to innovate their ideas. the students should be duly motivated about the advantages of the advanced learning with creativity. they should be given some rewards in one form or the another so as to make them feel motivated. Also the families of the students, mainly the parents should also engage in motivating them . government can also take some steps so as to change the rigid curriculun system to a system which inspire the students to do something new and innovative . but tyhe whole thing lies within ourselves. If the person himself is self-motivated, the re4sult will bw more good in comparision. Students should always engage themselves in doing some trhing new and doing some new researches which could addon some thing new to their knowledge and experience. Creativity and innovation should be everyones passion ."
27,1,1_218,"I dont claim to be an expert in educaton.I am still a student and i speak for myself.I belive that students should have a voice in the education system today.because manly they ar the ones who are being educatd .The contro of education should be in the hands of students.They should be centered first and foremost.consider a bird,when it is baby.it reside in the rest and cannot fly.Its parents bring food for it.So it generally developes a psychological dependence that must be overcome.parnt birds begin to reah them flying by remaining a short distance away during feeding-so the baby bird has to step away from the nest,and flytowards the food.IN the initial stages,it falls many tims,but eventually spreads its wings conquer the mighty sky.Each child taht is born like a baby bired to fly high and explore the hidden treasures of the world.They are not born with a non-creative gene.so why are students generally non creative.If a child is kept i protection at the age of 22,he/she has already lost their best years of creativity.forget the inspiratinal teachers and creative encouragement that many writers experienced at school.playwright Frank McGuiness recalls a schooling in the 1950's and 60's that stickens his stomach,and 'beat the lining out of love for exploring the intricies of language'.Remembering my school days in dongel in the fear"
28,1,1_270,"Education System in India is biased , biased towards the reservations , approaches and donations . If you have any of these no matter how much you know or intelligent you are you will get a good school or university to study.Well, apart from being biased our education systems lacks in many other things . For eg , our syllabus inculdes many useless topics or chapters or even subjects .The syllabus is not being being upgrade frequently the technologies or subjects which are outsorced are still there .Which makes student feels not worthy to read hence the syllabus is discouraging the students and making them lose intrest in studies.As soon as I am considered , India's education systems lacks in practical approach , only the theory classes are taken seriously by the teachers and when it comes to practical classes students are given assingment to write . No experience or new ideas or motivation are given to student to be the out of the box , to think differently .Only one thing is taught since the childhood score good marks no matter what your intrest is , no matter if you find it worthy or not read the book and score the marks .Our education systems doenot have a single thing to encourage the student to do some thing new , it just have procedures that student should follow to gain marks . It is very sad when it comes to teachers that how they appricates the student who thinks out of box , one student who has a very good hand on practical approches but he is not a bookworm during examination he wrotes the defination by his own not as per the books . No matter what he writes if it doesnot matches the book he will not get good marks this what our education system is .I am strongly agree that education systems needs to revised if it remains the same there will no room for imgination and creativity ."
29,1,1_44,"Today the world is dependent on the internet for everthings even the small child known about every activity of internet and so many social media activity.The people searcheach and every activity on internet and copy the idea of already exist.Our education system is highly affected by this like when we talk about the project presentation each and every project and topic present on internet so student do not try to think about itself the search and implement.   Our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity because presentally in education sytem everything is readymade we easily find anything which we want.Student are very happy for these type of system but it create difficulty for their own future,because they do not think about anything and kill our own imagination power.There are so many example of education syatem which so how people do their work like Slide-Share.It is also good for those student who only take a hint of these available information and the add their own ideas and creativity and do not copy it.The people are alway think better than a machine because it also developed by people,student are unable to see that the ideas on internet is also created by someone so they also able think like that even better than it so use your own ability of imagination. Finally in on the basis of above discuse satement I agree on the point that the education syatem do not leave the room ideas and imagination.So it is necessary for the student that they implement their own ideas and imaginaton any only take help to other do not copy anyone.The student are always think different because when a company whant to do anythinks even anyone whant to do ask about students so imagine and implement dont copy."
30,1,1_90,"The statement that is given above I do agree with it .In present education system their is no place for imagination and creativity,it is all about marks, grades, percentge.Present education system has made students to run after success,marks,percentage,ranks.We dont understand the concept we don't have any imaginination about our subjects.We simply mug-up the things and get good marks.Here in this system of education the knowledge acquired is nill  We do not go for any creativity, we have just became book-worms.So i oppose this kind of education system where only marks and grades are counted.If it was not about only marks students would have been more creative and had better imagination. In present generation not only students everyone run after success inturn which gives them a money for an luxury life style.But its not all about money.We should make use of what we have learnt and put it in a creative manner and then achieve success in a creative mannerNow a days people do not have time for any imagintaion or to b"
31,1,1_77,"The tightly defined curriculum of our education system gives us the idea for making the new ideas, imagination and creativity. Yes I agree with this, in a education system like our school, colleges, universities there are many curriculum activities like drama, sports, dance, song, etc are held to make students enhanced about our culture and social activities. These curriculum activities gives us to new idea about any new work that mean how to lead the team, how to initiate the plan, how to pefrom on stage and stage performance make them confident. We know studies are very important for our students but curriculum makes them extra ordinary and enhanced about another work which help them in future for there work that how to represents themselves in a social activity, company. Study makes student intellegent but these curriculum makes them smart and hard working. And they able to thinking the new ideas, creation, in there mind about there work. when they lead a particular team then easily learn that how to lead the team how to represent the group these all things gives them help in future, when they lead there team in a company or another things then these activities make them ensure to think about new ideas. Because they did all these work in there schooling which are curriculum. People do the things very accurately and successfully when they face these things previously in there life. When someone do work under pressure then they seriously perform it with a concern. So curriculum makes students enhanced to think large new ideas and creation .This not a negative point however I think it is a positive thing to devlop the mind of the students about another things about study, work, new ideas etc. These will be help them to perform well."
32,1,1_143,"Its true that our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity, but it is traditional way to teach a chilren. Now a days the system includes more good things in school and college. Like they do extra activity for students, competetions etc. buy our old education system should be change because the old education system is stressfull for childrens and also thier parents. In our education system the first thing is the syllabus. The syllabus is old and thier most of the syllabus is not usefull for future. The marking system is also not good, their are some bad points. in syllabus their are lot of things which are not usefull but stiil they are their. the assignments and class test should be taken seriously by the teachers and students also. we gave importance for the last exam because the last test carry our result it may be excellent, good , bad, pail, pass etc. but we should give importance each and every test so we can achive good things from the syllabus. the old things should be erased from the syllbus which is not in use in our daily life and also for the future. and we should add more new things in sylllabus. like what happend in now a days in our sociaty, poliytics, rsearch etc.their a time reserved for the p.t. i.e physical trainning. its is a sports time but teachers gave work for the students to clean the ground and do accadamics so what is the meanning of that slot of sport hour. some times the system not allow to sportspersons to play their games in accadamics time. it also happen that many more things comes at a time like exams and sports . so the student may be distract from their goal. in may school teachers do extra work apart from their teaching which is related to politics and so on.but we need to change our old education system. and give a room for creativity and imagination."
33,1,1_165,"In todays education system we have a tightly defined curriculum. I agree with this.It basically means that the course structure is rigid , and decided by the particular board or council. There is a fixed pattern of syllabus which contains certain subjects . The same examination pattern is repeated every year. There is no room for flexibility. There are no changes being done. The same pattern and syllabus is being followed since years.Whether it be the education system of a school or a college. Whether it be a technical field or a non technical one like business related , the course structure is tightly defined. It does not procvide any room anything new or creative. This is actually a system followed in India unlike in other countries. Here , in our education system the students are given a set of predefined syllabus . The students are supposed to study it and appear for the exam . This does not allow a proper development of mind since the students get nothing new to do. They get no chance to think and create anything on their own.Thuis, this drawback in our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity. The main drawback being that there is a lack of practical knowledge among students. Here, the system needs an improvement. There should be a change in the modules to enhance advancement. The students fom a very early age should be made to think, reason and imagine on their own. The more they will start thinking and imagining the more their minds will grow and develop. Not only this when given a chance even the students can lead to new innovations. This will also develop their personility.This improvement can be made by making room for imagination and creativity. And by giving a chance to explore more and learn more by themselves . Students should be made to do certain activities to develop new skills. They can even develop interest in activities like sports, and other cultural events.This will lead to the overall growth and development of oneself. And pave way for new inventions."
34,1,1_231,I am student of electronic &amp; communication engirreeing so ui have lots of during the class program bacause i have minor project work major project work and digital processing lab and produuctblab and inprepare for some important examination so i spend my whole time on that things so i have not enough time to somthing creative and think somthing creative . so i want express my idea here why the college make syllabus entresting creative. when in learn a intresting thing that i can do and think a creative thing because in engineering profession which people exist they are curious creative and think about somthing knew technology. so i want to say that tto university member they make a type sedule that satudent fell some freeness. because in this busy sedule people want some freshnes and creativness. and i suggest my freinds they make these type of a group they talk about new technology in free time they learn about new technology in free time . they memories and do lots funny thing in free time because in our life happyness is most important thing in our fastlife. so we also make our carriculam and in student life is most important time so in thatbtime people want to do no carriculam activity.  so we should orgnize a number of technical fest and in technical fest student learn lots of things and feel some free about study and learn some innovative things. just like IIT ROORKI organize a THOMSO. itb is best event orgnize in technical feild so student make a group and orgnize these type of event and during these event u make your leader ship quality and make a good freind amnd improve your freindcircle area . so these type event gives number of oppertunity to do and learn somthing  knew.
35,1,1_269,"Education system is main basic piller of our life. how we learn in school or college it is important. in education system curriculum are their they afects the creativity of our mind. some roles not allow think pratically .education is not only reading writting, some orther activity also required.sitting in classes they provide practical knowledge to students,teachers are skilled in that subject they encourage the students to learn easily.education mainly based on knowledge knowledge should not be restricted taking classes they show videos of pratical which subject they learing teacher do actions because action speaks louder than voice.teacher not give more pressue on students because student will afraid to learn that subject,students mind is such that they study in peaceful place ehose encourage the them.some curriculum are not good,given by system like avoid playing in ground not play with ball they are not followed by students.education is freely learned by students.some role like not talk in classroom students will talk about problem of maths physics or corresponding subjects.they learn about logical thinking mental abilities ,personality devolpement ,aptitude test are taking by staff members.in regular class from 8am t0 5pm that students not have freedom to think they have no time to creative works,they have to sit only for listening then their mind become to listining they donot have time spend for imagination and creativity,such these things avoided in education system.student who want practical knowledge they donot get it,their mind set will change,they forgot their working skills.taking only classes they provide meditation classes it will concentrate on activities,mind should be calm peaceful they think freely about creativity and imagination.tightly defined curriculm of our education leaves no room for imagination and creativity."
36,1,1_146,"It is true that strongly defined curriculum of education leaves no free time for extra activity. If I give my point of view towards college life, there is tightly defined curriculum for example class, many assignments, lab work on which only formality ids happened, different labs have different file work etc. By this lot of work any student is unable to think about his imagination and so there is lost of his creativity. It is always true that only college study or work is not sufficient for any student, Student should have some extra work or back plan to his life or to achieve his goal. And for achieve his goal,a student required lot of extra time apart from his college curriculum. So it is required for any university to make its curriculum which have lot of space for student's imagination and creativity.Now if we think about the another aspects of this situation, then we get for a college student (ex. engineering student), Universities should have a well defined curriculum because Engineering is a professional course and it required well disciplined work. But Universities should have more practical work as compared to theortical work. All colleges have labs for approximately every subjects. But there is formalities are happened in the most of the labs. It is current situation of our education system. So every University is required to change its old way and change it into modern way.So we have to change this way."
37,1,1_69,"The tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity.I Sudarshan Saxena student of B.Tech final year get completely agreed with the above situation. As nowdays competition is keep on increasing now days . At small it is between student level but if we see in on a large scale it is between the countries. Student of nowdays only have a limited bookish knowledge which make them just to pass the exam, But what after passing the exam is it enough?. As because of higher competition and tightly curriculum of our education many of the students attempting seucide. This is all because of tightly curriculum.Just because of tightly curriculum students are not getting time for doing what they love . All the time student has to be inside the books. This led to failure of the students as they are not getting room for imagination and creativity.As a result number of entrepreneur decreases year by year in our country. Many of the students goes outside india and start their bussiness, many get associated with good companies , many of them provide or sell their ideas to corporates outside our country because in our contry nobody value them and if they tell someone about it they were get embrasses by other by saying focus on studies only you are not Ambani`s or Mittal`s.As we see that Ambani`s and Mittal`s are also one of us and nowdays they are hairing thousand of us . The difference which take them to such a milestone is just and idea and creativity.Many students sell their ideas to company outside India and when the idea comes into real world as a whole prodect tham india buy that product from them see how ironic ,india need to buy its own product from another country.so the overall conclusion is that the tightness of the curriculum should be reduced so that students get room for imagination and creativity."
38,1,1_97,"The education system of India is very rigid. In India, the education system is focused on getting marks. The Universities are orthodox and rigid. Syllabus of our Universities are obsolete and outdated. Universities are not easily ready to change the syllabus. The process of changing the module of our education is very slow. It takes approximately 8-10 years to make a significant change.21st Century is the era of knowledge, if we have to compete with the world and become the superpower, then we should make our education according to the modern period. Any big countries like America, invest on their education system to bring innovations. On the contrary, people in India follow others innovations. We are made to follow others. This can be changed if we change our education system. We have to focus on practicals rather than theory. We have to focus on innovations rather than marks.Another reason for our low quality education system is unsatisfied teachers. Teachers in our country paid very less as compare to any other country in world. That is the reason teachers are not able to give their 200% for our educations system. Teachers are pillars of any nation, because they make the future of country. So, unless teachers are satisfied, our country will not become great.In our country most of people focus on getting job rather than creating jobs. That is the reason, they focus on marks rather than practical knowledge. Due to which the imagination power of students of our country is retarded. We have to make a system, where we motivate them to image and innovate. The curriculum of our education system is rigid, which gives no room to imagine and dream. Our system should make significant laws to bring out innovations from our country. We should encourage our generation to lead, not to follow."
39,1,1_258,"Education sysyem is quite good as far as in technological and practical exercise comapiring to develpoing countries.Development in education system is rising day by day as technology advanced and it is necessary to make modifications in education system.In every educational field there is two part of whole case study of syallbus i.e theory and practical.Many of the colleges are not focusing on practical area they only go for theory due to which many students not aware of actual operation and principle.  According to Developed countries,their education system is far different than develpoing countries,for example they plan their curriculam according to students interests and imagination also they more concentrate on practical.They plan the whole acedmic according to students interests of area in which they can do well.This the major difference in developed countries and developing countries.But defined curriculam is also necessary for students to get theoretical knowldege as per as university of education,there must be equivalency between defined curriculam and defining curriculam which is most important to intiate in education system. Tightly defined curriculam can stop the thoughts,imagination and creative idea of students which can be a bright future of student if they work properly on that idea.Tightly curriculam of our education system follows only the lecture part which is good upto certain limit because due to continous lecture there is loss of interest in gaining the knowledge delivered by lecturer,hence to regain the interest and mood there has to be change in tightly defined curriculam set up by board of education system.Byproviding a seprate class for imagination and innovation,students can research on new technology and can develop and upgrade their knowledge.  Hence, there must be period or slot for activity hour and innovation and creativity hour to build new things and redifine our tightly curriculam of education system."
40,1,1_100,"The education system in india is only therotical no creative and imaginative referencre is given to the students beacuse of which many problems arises . due to low practical exposure we are not able to develop the technology this has became the reason that we buy the technology from different country. As the curricullum in other country is mostly on imagination and creativity they became much experiment effective and can work different technology. The currillumyes defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity. as we have defined curricullum students stiks to to the curricullum. all wast portion dosnt allow student to divert there mind to creativity. instead of having a theory based can curricullum we need to have an imagination and creativity in currilulum an extra scope will be added to the students if they are able to imagine something and work on it.All this activity must be added to the curricullum to make students creative and future ready. only theory knowledge will not develop students.so to add an extra quality there to the students there must be different tasks carried out. imagination can consist of different experiments on technology , new technology and creativity must consist of doing something practical and taking out the result. the wast syllabus must be changed and some features such as creativity and imagination must be added where students can learn more not only by learning something but also by performing it. Ideas can be imagined can be performed and can be make happen or ture."
41,1,1_227,"I am totally disagree of this tightly defineed curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity. My biggest take away from this response is that the idea that World has changes dramatically and that the educational system has not changes much in over 200 years.All the students brings tremendous value to our classrooms.Simply because the current structure of the educational system values academic intelligence does not mean that only a sub-set of students who easily excel in this area of worth our time or are worthy of success in schools.If the arts capture our students interestsso well because they evoke their senses in such a strong way,how can we create lessons in maths,spanish,writing or world history that do the same things? certainely there are students who are improperly medicated because they find it difficult to focus on boring school lectures that do not attempt to engage them.A teacher would be wise to consider many means of engaging students and helping them focus prior to believing that they may be afflicted with this condition.The imagination and creativity are the central to the idea of education being about inculcating a love of learning,of acquiring knowledge.A good education includes a good imagination nd creativity ,introducing children and young people to great literature"
42,1,1_40,"True to the proverb, Where there is a will, there is always a way, saying that the current curriculum spares no time for imagination and creativityis just a lame excuse. The tightly defined curriculum of our education system is indeed a boon as it teaches the way to systematic thinking and hardworking successful life. For instance, the great mathematicians and scientists of the world who have contributed the vital portions of science and technology are all from India who have grown up in the same Indian scenario of education system, yet have proved to be pioneers in the history of the world. Sunder Pichai, the CEO of the google, is an Indian. The list doesn't end here. The smart, creative and intelligent youngsters of India are embrased by almost all the American and European companies for their own technology development. All this is still happening with the present education system. I believe that the current education system is designed in such a pattern that it lays the basic foundation for further application. If a student studies diligently, with deep understanding and not just for the sake of scoring an A grade the present system is sufficient and forms a platform where the student can imagine and bring creative innovations into existence. A systematic early morning wake up when the mind is all fresh spares lots of time for creative thinking and imagination. Every successful person on this earth had the same number of hours to work and be successful. So the three key factors that lead to successful imagination and creativity are: time management, personal interest and systematic life."
43,1,1_164,"In todays era harwork combined with education is the key to success. In whichever field we move in order to excel in that field we need to have good education, and off course nowdays we are gettintg proper education and this education system which is prevailing today not only enhances our wisdom but also focuses on imagination and creativity.We cannot deny with the fact that along with gaining knowledge we aur also improving our imaginative power and becoming creative. Taking the example of schools along with having theoritical subjects we also have subjects like art, craft,supw etc as well as we have team projects ,various competitions like mehndi,rangoli,drawing,bullitien board decoration etc which make a kid creative.Not only schools but colleges also have such activities through which we get to know about the hidden talents of our friends . Colleges also have these non -tech competitons as well as they have technology related competitions like robotics , car making, etc in which a student needs to use all his imaginative power to give it his best shot and come out with flying colours. I don,t think that there exist any institution where such activities are not held and the only focus is on theory. Every institution gives room to such extra curricular activities which brings out the best of a person .So it all depends upon oneself wheather we participate or not. We cannot blame our education system for this because they are giving oppurtunities to us to make us imaginative and creative but it all depends upon us wheather we make the best use of that oppurtunity or not or just sit aside and have theoritical knowledge which is all waste without proper imaginative power and there would'nt be any innovations in the world."
44,1,1_57,"The topic is the THE TIGHTLY DEFINED CURRICULUM OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM LEAVES NO ROOM FOR IMAGINATION AND CREATIVITY. In the education system we are having many more imaginations and dreams about our carrier and we are having many aims. In education the every student have brilliant mind to made a creativity things for making or doing the creativity things we have to plan for the perticular thing,and then we have to imagine how it will work and we have to think more for the different kinds of creativity. our education system is best education system compare to another. In our education system we learn so many things and we will get more knowledge by doing more projects and always thinking about anything to create a new thing in to the world. In our education system we not only learn about book related subjects we learn out of syllubus things and we also learn about cultural activities. Once we learn all things next we have to think for more what we should do for the crativity things. How we will do and what are the requirments for doing the creativity thing these are all the preparation and planing for doing the creativity things and for doing the creativity things first we have to take imagination room for the creating the new things in to the world. For our education system the imagination room is required for thinking and planing for the new things or creativity things. We have to bring a more new things in to the market and what we will bring that will be in the correct way and that will get the profit from our decision to do the creativity. The all students having the creativity mind but they have to use them mind and take them mind into the imagination room then only they do any creativity things otherwise it is not possible for them. Without imagination room no one can plan for the new things or bring the new ideas in to the market. In education system the students must have the room for imagination and creativity. The student have the room for imagination and creativity the he will get succss in education system."
45,1,1_313,"Curriculum of education system is very tight in the running era. Students do not get enough time to enjoy their childhood. If they are not able to enjoy than obiously mind will not be able to focus or concentrate on the day today tasks and education too. Imagination and creations are the things which require a stable condition of mind, which can only be obtained by proper arrangement and utilization of time according to our body requirement.Now adays schooles and colleges have a very hactic schedule as aresult of which they are not able to envolve in games, exercises and other physical works which is a very important part of their life. Growth can be proper only when child is taking full diet and proper evolving in doing physical efforts.School authorities must also understand the needs of the students, they should try to give burden as less as possible to the students. They schould also organize physical activity contest in their schools also so that child will get attention toward it and stress on them can also be reduced by these things. creativity of students can only be understand if we are in frank behaviour with them. Imagination can also be developed in a positive way only by winning the interest of the children.Government of India is doing very right steps in this field. education level has increased in India from last few decades. Midday meal, game tournaments, proper personality programmes and keen intrest in their study are playing an important role. only not schools, parents also play an important role in the life of students. they can be their role model, by dooing a behaviour with them in a manner which will be leading them toward their physical and mental growth.At last i would say schedule of schools and colleges must be deciced in away such that child get aproper time get their mind freshed. Also if he is not envolving himself in outdoor activities than prents schould force them to move outside for somite, as it is very essential for developing creative and imaginative thoughts.                          HEALTH + CREATION + IMAGINATION = SUCCESS"
46,1,1_113,"Present scenario of our education system is that just producing or manufacturing unskilled person without giving any experience to them. Basically our education system curriculum based on most of the therotical part where main focus to get good marks in university exams and to study practicals for preparation of external oral exam. In whole semester there was burden on every student to complete assignments, experiments, practicals, attendendence,etc. Due to this such work there is no time remains for students for imagine and create something new. Nowdays main goal of student is to increase CGPAand apply for good companies in campus. But how is it possible to get job in best company? due to lack of experience and imagination credibility.    To avoid any consequences after the bachelors degree, our system need to get change in the way it presented towards students from the begining. From the first years of engineering students getting feared due to the experience they heard from their seniors. So when students started study their basic aim to avoid ATKT's. The burden of writing and drawing works they reqired to submit they are not get enough time. So there is need to focus on practicals and giving room for imagination and creativity instead of writing works.    For this, give extra time for students apart from the regular lectures. Conduct Presentations made by students it self, conduct Group Discussion to share view on any topic, conduct Seminars to guide the students, etc. This will help students to increase in self confidence, presentation skill,etc &amp; to become a more successful Engineer in future."
47,1,1_152,"Introduction: The tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity, sometimes seems to be right. In the present time the good schools give such a hard curriculum to their student so that they are not able to be part of things in which they want to get involved. To clear the examination with good marks is not only become the status of student but parents too. Everyone including school focus on improving CGPA and do not try to build student trained along with educated. Students because of pressue and stress sometime take wrong step. Our system follw old tradition education. The education should be such which make the student physically sharp, logically strong and energetic and mentally strong. If education system try to focus on increasing strength of stydent along with education so the future generation will be brillant in every field.Measure for improvement: Government should have to take some measure to make student free from useless burdun. As the requirement of time is much more. Each and every industry want their employee to be alrounder so to fulfill this target the situation has to be improved. people should focus on trained their children not only in theoritical basis but in sports, health improving exercise and many more. To build the well trained nation some basic improvement has to be taken time to time. The increasing expectation from both side the school or industries and family both should be fulfill by the use of above mention precaution. One thing should also include which is increasing student participation in the policies making for them. All we have to do is impllement these measures as soon as possible. to make country good and rapildly increasing groth og country our aim to focus on the active participation of student."
48,1,1_153,"introduction-i disagree with this statement,the education system in our nation has widewith the new era of the imagination thatfind in various schools and colleges they motivate their students and also enhance their knowledge. they give the space and room to their ability and imagination. there are various activities happens in the colleges and schools and they also encourage students to paticipate and communicate with each other, and shows their interests. the teachers give them proper knowledge and incolleges they create researches in colleges within the guidence of the profesors that have experiance. this shows that their imagination and creativity increase with time. without knowledge and imagination one should not do the researches and works.imagination and creativity- every one has their imagination and creativity that should be enhanced by the experianced persons. this happens in the schools and collleges. students also find the space in the games which enhance their imaginations. now a days students tells each and every thing to their professors and teachers they are frendly and strict for work both. this shows the creativity andefficiency in the human developing by their teachers. every person can know their ability with the help of their teachers and their guidence. the culturual activity and the function in the place increase the frendly environment. and the strictness to create work on time also increase students skills.conclusion- the colleges and schools are the place where one can increase their knowledge and enhace the skills. as we knowthe knowledge enhance the imagination capability and the skills make us more creative. both imagination and creativity very important in present time to grow in the society and in the organisation so the enhance there in a person is very important in present time. this is only happens with the contribution of the education system that create a well impressive personality now a days."
49,1,1_195,"Imagination and creativity is the mother of invention. The education system for the student must be framed in a way where there must be more emphasis is given to the practical application of their studies. If the curriculum does not include practical application than students will not be able to think out of box and which the need of current scenerio. Education system of our country must understand that increasing only theroritical knowledge will not contribute in overall mental developement of child.A research have revealed that students those who spend time on internet and sports they perform far better than students those who only focus on class room studies.It is the necessity that education system must change there stereotype system of education and must introduce new way of learning. There are so many new international schools are operating in our country which work on activitybased learning and give the knowledge to the students that is in there syllabus but also give the knowledge which is related to it. Audio-visual based learning retain for longer period of time in the mind of the students than traditional based learning.Teachers must introduce new way of teaching like activity based, fun based, use of audio-visuals etc. this will strengthen the retention power of students and they try more to participate in learning because it will be a fun for tham.Rather defining specific curriculum education system should include project based curriculum that have practical implimentation.A study was done on students of indian studentsto compare there mental ability and it revealed that students are very hardworking but less creative as compared to US school students.I wish the Government of India will surely take some positive stepstoward the developement of students."
50,1,1_32,"Yes I agree this statement because an education is very important for every children. Its increases the capability and thinking has been develop the children's. Every person has own thinking and own point of view to generate new ideas for the whorld. Many artist has been develop our imagination and creativity thinking.Creativity is the out of box thinking. It is the combination of inventation and innovation. Creativity has make things beautiful and its inspire the other people also. In schools and colleges their are many curriculum activities which is done by the students. They paricipate in all activities or event and shows our cabailities and performance.Imagination is also out of box. It is synnonums of creativity. Imagination is good or bad its depends on the thinking behaviour of the person. Most of the people not like the creativity or imagination of the other person. Education is very basic knoweldge and its very important for evey person . Without imagination we cannot generate ideas and new things. Ideas has been any type its is related to business or creativity something new. Its depends on the behaviour of person.Our education system leaves room for imagination and creativity because its for benfitally for students. Its important for every person imagination its develop our nation or our country. For example Prime Minister of India Mr. Modi they take new decision to related stop black money or currency related problem. Its decision was very ggod for our nation . Her imagination was very well and its benefically for lower class and middle class people. Its stop the curruption in India. Its also focus on th girl child education specially because most of the area girls education was stop. It is wrong,every child has Right to get education.So Imagination or creativity is important for every child and its develop our nation."
51,1,1_278,"Education is the root cause of growth of any individual.It makes us innovative and let us discover things which we are inclined to do.Eduaction gives us the knowledge of our surrounding,our society and all the several aspects of life.India,being a land of diversity somwhere lacks in giving the optimum education required for a human being.Here, we only focus on the theoritical part rather focussing on giving practical knowledge to our students.I totaly agree with the above statement given.Our country fill the minds of the students with all sort of bookish knowledge and deviate them from the path of sorting their true identity in their life.Today,Students are facing all kinds of hurdles in their life due the lack of substantial knowledge they are needed to be given.They are doing the wrong things and taking the incorrect decisions and finally ending up their life in room full of depression and frustation.We don't allow our children to imagine the world at the fullestand fill it with the colours of their own choice rather we are filling their bags with heavy books which are not only a burden to them but also cuts the plant of creativity from their soul.Our education system need to look into the broader perspective.Students should not be forced to choose to becomeDoctors,Engineers,Lawyers etc instead they shuld be uplifted and motivated to study the course of their own choice,to choose the field of their own interest may it be from any field like art,history,politics,fashion,acting ,science etcWe need to educate our students the right way and tell them what is wrong and what is right but the decision should be left on them to choose their own creative world.India will not be left as a developing country if the youth of our nation is lead and enlightened towards the innovative education and practical knowledge."
52,1,1_321,"By the way today's education system needs many modifications if we think that the student is getting burdened. But according to me our system is best for multiple-subject based knowledge. Because our system has streams which lead to a diverse opportunities. To achieve that, one have strive hard so that he/she is eligible for every opportunity it leads. Anyways if we think that the students should choose what they want to achieve in their future at the schooling itself, then we can blame our education system for burdening the students with unwanted curriculum. Since the AIM  of the student is already set, the extra curriculum added will be burdening. If we think in this manner, the students can achieve more and explore more in their interested fields. And also can take place in extra co-curricular activities.In this way the students can achieve extra knowledge off their text books. They can do projects or other extra curriculum related activities. It is very difficult to come to a conclusion in this matter. Because every student don't built their dreams to be achieved in their future or many even don't know the diverse opportunities available out their. And also the situations in the future may change such that the stream selected by the student might not have scope.So we can say that the present system of education is better for majority of point of views. To achieve that one has acquire knowledge every Basic field. And it is the duty of the student to make time for himself in this tight curriculum for the enrichment of creative aspects. For example, instead of spending all the vacations enjoying or touring one has to indulge himself in acquiring more knowledge in fields interested or in the fields that will help him in the future to achieve his goals."
53,1,1_88,The tightlly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity because the schedule of people are becoming very busy day by day so they dont have much more time for imgining new things and to do creativity also so due to this education system is depriving day by day.and the burden of studies are increasing for the children. so they dont have time to think about other extra curriculum activites. creativity is being negected now adaysA creative process can begin with flash of new ideas or with a hunch..its a process not a single event .too often now we are systematically alternating for their own talents and therefore from from the whole process of educationour education system is becomingincreasingly dreary and monotonous. its no suprise to me that so many kids are pulling out of it. even the onces who are often detached . only a few people have fbenifi of this processAs creativity and imagination grooms the the thinking skills through this we can grow our thinkings skills.but due to tightly definedcurriculum of our eduction system children have disguised from the imgaiantion and creativitywe should promote these skills being a teacher or eductior its a resposnsibilty of him or her to grrom these skills in the studentsso that they can achive sucess in therir life rather than marks because marks will not go with you also you will be famous only with your creativity so me must look after for this also. there are two ways of thinking about these skills first of all we can teach genric skills of creative thinking justr in waty we can teach people to read write there are some skills which can free you if you learn those skills
54,1,1_220,"i disagree with the given statement. our education system is modified and how it does not on;y concentrate on books or just teaches a student to learn bookish things. there are noiw courses for your craetivity and now the more creative your are the higher probability will be of you to getting a better job. Now there are classes in schools to show your creativity and that can include anything be it dance, singing, creative art, your imagination which can bring anyb change.  The cuurent curriculum of our education systemdoes not eat time or make the life of student hectic or stressful instetad it has become more friendly with student. with the change in time and change in lifestyle of people the system has also chaanged. now the time is of technology and internet so students are moving towards e learning.stuidents are being more creative compared to some years ago. now they are more creative . the current system of education helps in thinking more diversily and in a other way."
55,1,1_62,"The tightly defined curriculum of our educations system leaves no room for imagination and creativity, because due to very hard syllabus of our education system, we only depends on marks and percentage. we all getting a more marks and percentages. No one think about a imagination and creativity. Students are only have dreams about there percentage and marks. They do not develop their inner qualities. They only think about readiment materials, and only RTE HUA ANS. I think every once think imagination and creativity , and this bases they wents get good marks. and they are very happy in thier study and thier lifestyle. They are heplful for their in future. I can not said marks are not important in our life, but iamgination and creativity is also important.Because many thinks depending on a imagination and creativity. like events , sports etc.. So i am dissagree the tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity.I am vrey much intrested on imaginations and creativities."
56,1,1_38,"We live in a world that creative,we live in atime where innovatin is the key word;innovations by human have reached every sphere of life.We can not deny the fact that much of the education that has been imparted till now has been menory-based.But proper learning should involve memory-based learning that triggers the cultivation of use of analytics, proper evaluation of skills and avove all, the presence of creativityk,n the urge to create something new that would bring about an evolution! We have to stop and and think- can we really teach our kids now tobe creative within the boundaries of a classroom or is it something that is inborn? Creativity is definitely different to different people and for some, inventing new ways to do the some things might be creative; while for ohters, discovering new things is all about creativity.But whatever is the concept, motivation should be given to be more inventive in education.As a teacher, you can do lot to cultivate creativity among your students and let them utilize their btain.Share with your class the attribute of being a creative person though the lives of great names in the creative field; sharing their life stories including how they used to generate ideas or how they dealt with all kind of reactions from everyone around will surely motivatethem. Discussion on how important it is for everyone to be curious to learn new things and also how to deal with failure should also be included. For all these discussion and oher motivational activities, being the teacher, you must develop a creativity"
57,1,1_306,"CURRICULUM OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEMIn todays, our country leaves no room for imagination and creativity. I agree for this statement , beacuse that the reason of lots of population in our country. the space for our education system is less. In India no of liabrary is too less for self education and practice space or ground for sports activity ground is not well maintained. In India many sports activity but people cant entered or participate because the reason of no practice space available. And colleges, schools ground also too small and staudy is also important that time could not do practice. on sunday or other off days we can do but in a public place or outside the house or park. not in other ground. in our education system which is requirement of improvement in our country. because education is must for us is also for poor people in government schools provide a proper education and help to grow as per requirement and help to generate creativity in every people because india people has lot of creative and do lots of wok and talended people.we are create the event in every month thats lots of people join us and do the imagination and creativity for our country and given credits to the people."
58,1,1_228,"I am totally agree with this statement,there should be a platform for creativityand imagination because IMAGINATION AND CREATIVITY LEAD TO THE NEW INVENTION.We can clearly see some examples from past inventions,like invention of Light Buld by Thomas Adition,this is a beautiful invention of the world.His imagination power and Creativity lead to this invention.Imagination actually gives birth to new things and Creativity makes Something Beautiful.But these all are not included in our education system.There is alot of courses for technical and non-technical branches but there are no more courses for these.Only it is considered as a passing subjects for some graduation courses.Actually students take these subjects like arts to just to pass the exam and to have degree.They does not take it seriously.If these are seriously taken then it can lead to more and more development,talent,undestandabilityand also creativity.These helps to improve understandability of the people on any thing and also improve their hidden talent.Suppose if these subjects are included in our course as a compulsory subjects then it mght be possible that people began to take interest in these subjects and they can identify their hidden talent and creativity.IMAGINATIONhelps people to have some concept on every thing no matters what our subject is.People may have their own imagination and talent to thing diffrently on different things.cREATIVITYmakes anything beautiful,So it can be used as a professional choice for the peopleEXAMPLE-Launching of new currency in india is actually a result of imagination by our P.M and his peopleSo genetrally these should be treated as compulsory modules to improve people undestandability and profession and can lead to new research.Therefore Government should take some serious steps to include some subjects releated to this.It will defenately helps to improve everyone understandability,creativity talent and also defenately their profession."
59,1,1_186,"In education,there should be no room or boundation for learning and acheiving some thing new.But unfortunately,today,In our developing era of education system.we have tranfomed it into a room with cage i.e,system with hectic schedulesand rules.This compells our country's student tobe focus on theoretical knowledge than practical aspects.In today's senerio all the colleges want to good rank therefore they are mainly focusing on percentage of students therefore they make tight curriculum schedule for students.the effect of this that the students will focus on subject but they can't focus on practical knowledge.This effects on the career of the all students and after compeletion of education they suffer to find job.Beacause we have to good practical knowledge as per the company requirement.But the high competetion of getting good marks in curriculum is make pressure on student and because of that they can't reach out the practical knowledge.For incresing the capacity of students we should give proper relaxation to the students to think about them and find where they can acheive there goal.This will effect on students life that the efficiency will increase and the student can find where is the interest area of them.Because marks is not everything in life and marks will also increse when student want that but can not forcely increase the marks of student."
60,1,1_246,"I agree with the curriculam of our education system. its totaly build up our personality and creativity. there are so many agenda which is included in our education system lie scholarship programme for higher study and for the student also who dont have money to study further. I tottaly agree that there are so many peer pressure for student . they are going in strees ,comitting sucide and may be take another wrong decision but among these reason there are no fault of study and education system. there are some another factor which is responsible for that like our societry and our rules and regulation. we may suffer beacuse of ourselfs not other. so its tottaly stupidity if we are saying that our curriculam or uor education system is wrong or those are responsible for that.Now a days the richer bemoes richer and poor becomes poor because of our system and policies but if a student want to study further then for him or her thee are so many ways for that our government pay for the student in the forms of scholership. banks also gives the loans.And if we are talking abot the peer pressure of student ,so there are many ways to come overcome of pressure like parents can help them and so many psychatricts are there. And one more thing if parents always care for his children then there is no pressure . so parents should be very careful aboutr this we cant blame this for a student. nobody can be blame for the peer pressure comes through studystudy is also a part of creativity. there are so many things in our education system by which we can show our creativity. the are and craft is also a part of study. and so many educational institution are there for art and craft and so many creativi activitySo at last we can say that there is no fault in our curriculam of our educati9on system. we are responsible for our mistake."
61,1,1_339,"According to the concerned topic , I would agree to a extent that really there is no scope for imagination and creativity which is the base of preliminary education.Our modern society always expects a rat race struggle paced life which have ahuge impact on a student's mind .They are nearly becoming machines nowadays as they have been taught fromschools to college under a strong vigilence of strict schedule.The education system donot provide spare time for creative works or professing their hobbies which may someday lead to their ultimate talents.The main complain is the cumbersome syllabus interpreted in schools which reduce their time to play outdoor games.Our education system should be presentable as if it can be modified since our childhood ,the child could express their creativity and make their own choice of education.There will be irreparably no judgement in education based on realm of society.The study of reading and learning will be so pleasing that children develop their own desire to learn rather than provoking them or insist them to study when they are reluctant to do it.As we have freedom to right our education so we should be set free for our choice of education system instead of being deviated by parental pressure."
62,1,1_11,"Yes,i am agree with the above statement that our tightly defined curriculum of education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity .It is necessary for the education system to teach the students for new creations which leads their imagination power strong.The education system required to provides the proper platform to the students to become the experts in the field of creativity due to which the studentswill also improve their imagination power.For this,system has to reduce the load and burden of studies(bookish knowledge) upon the students.So,the stuents will get the proper time for its extra circular activities which will help the students to make his imagination power strong.The students improves his imagination and creativity talentonly if they free from the stress of studies and get the proper time.In today scenario,all the schools and colleges wants to be ranked in education system with a good position.For this,they only tried to teach the studentsin this way which is enough for them to got the good marks in exams.But they don't tried to increase the creationand imagination power of students.The school and college system only thinks about theirstatus and their position among other schools and colleges.They only compete with other schools and colleges due to which students are to be suffered and in this way they only became expert in the bookish knowledge and not in the field of creativity.And a student is unable to show his talent ,his imagination and creative mind if they only has the bookish knowledge.It is required forthe education system to improve their education status by improvingthe status of creativity and imagination power in students."
63,1,1_148,"It is often said that creativity is the wild mind and a disciplined eye.We,in the era of tweenty first century believe in creating our own path and making it a historic way for others to follow if in this situation we don't have a creative mind and imaginative sense.But education highly needs innovations.Creativity can be defined as the willingness to be couragious and to try new things.Creative people take risks and produce some of the best ideas.Iconic designer, Michael Wolf has never been afraid of trying new things and thus have achieved a lot in his career through his passion and vision.It is a well known saying that we learn from our mistakes.How we are preventing ourselves to do mistakes is a big challenge. The existing education system needs to be more flexible because sometimes boreing and steady path decreases the enthusiasm to learn and to make students more interested into all what they need to achieve in future,it is must that they learn to take risk and innovate simultaneously.Creativity and imagination is often blocked by the fear of being wrong.But the young generation should not be afraid of being wrong.They should be attracted to be the limelight by innovating things by exploring the learnings.So we need to nurture creativity in the classroom. Having pupils look at their final product and reflect on what they did right as well as what they did wrong is very important.Teachers provide supportive environment that encourages risk takig by acting as a role model.Through their role model they see that taking risk and being imaginative is a valuable and necessary part of learning.By providing classroom environment that encourages the education and learning in the best creative manner possible.There is an another important role of family in the education system this is to boost up their children to explore their imaginative minds.As learning begins at home the parents have the most important role.Thus the education should indulge creativity and exploration so as to enhance the convulations of a students."
64,1,1_155,"Introduction- In our india the education system is very normal there is no more space for the creativity. Student diven lessons when teacher lead the lessons, it leaves no space for the student to learn. When student are just given all the information, there is no room for them to think as to how that solution is derived. It slows down their thinking process. Teacher should foucs on student driven lessons that are teaching them how to drive the solution instead of just providing them with all the answerDesign for thinkingDesign thinking means learning by doing. Design thinking methods unleash creativity, logic, intution and imagination. Knowledge is not something that should be forgotten once the semester end. It should only increase with time. Insteasd of rewarding children for memorising, they should be rewarded for their creativity, thinking and their level of innovation.Problems and SolutionThe primary education in india should foucs on helping children find solution to problem and problems to solution. Instead of giving the solution to every problem, we should encourage children to find problems to the solution taht have not been discoverd yet. This would help them develop a prespective.ConclusionCreativity: its been maligend, neglected, and misundrestood. But it's finally coming into its own.

68,2,2_346,"Humans are an innovative creation of the almighty. They can walk, talk, express, feel, behaveand most importantly they have brains. If I talk about the stone age era, man learned how to lit the light simply using by two stones, that was the incredible invention. Slowly and gradually, man has become the pioneer to rule this existing world. Various ages had passed away, beat its vedic times or maurayan rule or akbhar's dynasty or british rule, one thing that was prominent that there used to be a clear distinction between a leader andfollowers ora king and his kingdom and most importantly the controversial topic to debate on from ages is between a poor and a rich.Studies have revealed that poors are becoming poorer and richs are becoming richer. Today despite being years of advancements, the abridge between have andhave-nots still existed. Reasons are very loud; selfish interests where one in power is humiliating the one without powers. If I talk about our existing political system, they are pretty good at making fake promises than fulfilling those promises rather they are busy filling in their coffers with money and that has what lead to the evolution of so called demon- Corruption. Statistically figures say that Seemapuri though lieson the periphery of Delhi, still is away from that growth. One could see many troops from Dhaka have made their jhuggi jhopadi there, entire family including small kids are working as ragpickers to earn their livelihoods increasing child labour also. It seems that for these kids its like stolen springs. Not only this, even in Firozabaad where bangle making is the only occupation for the families living in flithy slums, has trapped the small kids again into the vicious circle of death where all they know is making bangles, continuously working for money in dark chambers, which has even made them loose their eye-sight.Government should take serious actions to help these poor sections of our society. They could launch programs where these families could get elementary food, elementary education and also rather than begging for money, government should start some employment giving programs where these people could learn how to earn their livelihoods like jewellery making, tailoring, etc. For poor peoplewe could start some free meals program to solace these hungry soulsEven we as an individual shoul take it as an responsibility ce and rather than treating them as unwanted weeds, we can help the needy at our level by educating them.As someone as well said, if even one petal is torn out, the beauty of a flower diminishes. So, lets take it as a pledge to stand together and make our world a beautiful place to live in."

Because there are many reasons of that like-corruption, blackmoney etc. Many people are doing many illigal works which are prohibited but many people doing this. Many poor people cannot buy a day's meal for itself. It makes our Delhi very poor. It creates corruption and many people doing everything they want by just using money like admissions and many more things. Many poor people do not take admissions just because these people.And a best remedy for this problem is demonetization. It is the step was already taken by the Govt. of india. By this step, reducing in corruption and cracking out all the black money in India. In dis step ceased the currency notes 500 and 1000. This step made poor anr rich people equal for everybody.And second best remedy is increasing the emplyment rate. Create more opportunities for skilled people or unskilled people. That makes poor people are able to take what they want. This step makes each and every people are able to buy meal for itself. And everybody should generate more jobs for those people who are willing to do job. If we want beggar free India so, we have to do something for making beggar free India.In India everybody have rights to live their life in their way. so, generate more and more jobs for people. And do business for generating jobs for those people who are begging in India."
71,2,2_46,"We all know that our contry is not economically as stong as other western countries.Though there are some people who have very much wealth in their hands.they are miss using their wealth.so here we can see some problems and their remedies-Every richest man has many accounts in outer countries so government should take some steps to stop that.Another main problrm is most of the people who are not the government employee are not giving the tax so govtshould postasupervisor in every cities to see that type of people.After some cirtain periodCBI rade is important for suspesous persons.In west Bengal our honourable chif minister gives 'Kannasree' many non government employees are misusing that so there should be some inspection.Now coming to the poor people firstly they should be given proper chance for their education.Schools,colleges should provide scolarships for them.We know already govt is giving rice,carosine,wheet etc in a low price.So that type of health is needed.Now the main reason of this gap is unemployment.So proper education,opportunity can help to remove this problem.So when we can think we all are same no one is rich or poor only that time we can decrease the gap between rich and poor.we all need that type of mentality.Its our duty to make people equall.We should be happy for what we have."
72,2,2_209,"Rich are becoming richer and poor are becoming poorer. There are many reasons for this some of them are corruption, improper implementation of the rules, policies depending on the caste system rather than on the economic status of the people and outdated policies of the government. If this continues to be the same only few people can lead a life with food and other facilities. In the present days as 500 and 1000 rupee notes are banned it somehow help to determine the illegal activities of the people. If the technology usage is increased widely like online banking, card transactions, each and every rupee is made through records some of the problems will get reduced. New policies have to be framed by the government to have a change in the people. If the wealth which is in the hands of rich people is given to the poor people then most of the life will change. All the illegal activites should be banned by the government. If the reservation is given to the poor people based on the economic status and promotions and jobs are given based on the capability of the persons applying then there will be a change in the society today. People who are educated and interested in making government policies should form the government and change the policies.Society should think in a proper way and should avoid illegal activities like corruption to form a good nation. In future we should be able to see a society without gaps in the economic status."
73,2,2_123,"The increasing gap between rich and poor is plaguing our society. This vast gap between the rich and the poor is due to the increasing 'black money' . We can see corruption in every aspect of life.Due to this the upper poverty line people are growing more and the lower class people are suffering. Half of the earth's wealth lies in few of the hands and reamaining people find it hard to feed themselves. there's a lot of gap in between the rich and the poor due to which the people who are affected are the poor people.The poor people are not growing in terms of lifestyle, there is no growth in their income. Due to this, there is a lot of inequalities arrising between the rich and poor. The rich people are on the top with no financial problems but the one's who suffer are the poor people who can't afford to even buy a meal once a day. The rich people are becoming rich day by day and the poor people are declining below the poverty line.The consequences of this problem are too many and the people who are affected by it are the poor people. It follows a simple rule more the corruption , more the gap. there should be steps taken by the government to bridge the gap between the rich and poor.The recent demonetisation of the old currency can help to bridge the gap between the two societies which are formed in our country i;e the rich and the poor. There are people who can feed the entire nation with thier money while there are certain people who cannot even afford to find a day's meal. this increasing gap should me minimised by washing out the corruption in our nation.therefore, it's our duty ti bridge the gap between the rich and the poor."

76,2,2_72,"There&#039;s a saying that &#039;the nature has sufficient resources for a man&#039;s need but not for anyone&#039;s greed&#039;; the masses who were already in a better position because of their ancestral wealth that came down to them were able to use and exploit these resources well, however, the downtrodden who came to this planet with nothing but a sky above their head and a piece of earth to lie down couldn&#039;t stand up much to the wealthy people and hence, couldn&#039;t get to use the resources for themselves. It can be assumed that the problem started from there and gap begin to form. With the passage of time, the gap widened because how can the poor get a start to do something if all the resources that he can lay his hands upon have already been taken away by the wealthy devils for their own satisfaction? The gap that created ensured that the poor had very little to no say in the life he had to lead with minimal resouces left over to be used for his daily needs, as his voice will always be stamped upon because no body will care the ultimate death of the poor. It is the rich they want to secure and protect with supreme levels of security having alphabets X, Y, and Z and not the poor. Another consequence is, if at all, any poor rises by his own strength and will power and challenges the world with his extraordinary talent and thinking power and is confronted with a problem that requires money as the solution, death is the ultimate option that will be left for him; the great life of our talented Mathematician Ramanujan is a proof. One possible way of solving this problem and bridging the gap is by the rich inculcating a mentality by giving it back to the nature from where he amassed all his wealth. It should strike him that all that he or his ancestors obtained was from the nature and giving it back to the nature, here, in this case, the society by helping the havenots rise up, by searching for talents among the poor, upbringing them, nurturing them and eventually building a platform where everyone from the society is working in a harmonious manner ultimately leading to the overall development of the nation. A selfless endeavour for humanity and a stepping stone of success for the nation which others can follow."

78,2,2_80,"There are lots of critical problems on the earth. Some are created by people of the earth and some are natural. One of the biggest problem of the earth is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. The rich is becoming rich day by day and the poor is suffering from poverty. This is not an ignorable problem. The consequence of this problem is very huge and effective.There are many causes to arise this situation of gap. Firstly, Iwould like to criticise some political background people. In our political system democracy plays vital role, because aware the people from their rights in society. But, Some people playwith democracy. They raise their hands in election to be the responsible for people's problem but, after winning theelection with a great majority they do nothing for the people. Our country takes lone from other friends counrty but the money could not reach among the public. Some responsible people of our society hides that people's development money.Secondly, the people could not get the proper amount of salary from the work they do. Therichpeoplemakes money with the help of labours power but, they do not provide sufficient amount of money for the work labours do. In other hand government is also not capable to provide government services to all the people of our country.Thirdly, many of the people do not get a job according to their qualification so they become unemployed, this is also a big problem to create a gap between rich and poor. There are several other problems which are trying to create a gap. The consequence of this problem is very problematic. This problem can create a very big problem for the existance of mankind.So, we all should try to fill the gap between rich and poor using unity of our society. People should each others in need. We should provide a good salary to the laours of our companies."

80,2,2_167,"The gap between the poor and the rich has stretched to its widest levels since time immemorial. Economic inequality also referred to as gap between the poor and the rich, wealth disparity or income inequality consists of the differences in the the income and wealth distribution. Typically the term, the gap between the poor and the rich refers to inequality among groups and individuals in the society, but can as well refer to inequality among countries. The gap between the poor and the rich is related to the concept of equity: oppurtinity equality and outcome equality.There are several reasons why there is a growing gap between the poor and the rich within societies. These reasons normally are interrelated. The major factors that are seen to affect the growing gap include innate ability, culture, education, globalization,labor markets, policy, tax reforms, technological changes, racism, gender, inequality in salaries and wages. A moajor cause of the growing gap between the poor and the rich within modern economies is the wage determination by the capitalist market. For instance, in a situation where there are many workerswho are willing to do a job for a desirable time, then the supply of labor will be high for that job. On the other hand, there will be a low demand for a job in cases where there are few persons willing to do the job. When the supply is high and the demand is low for a job, there will be a lowwage.In conclusion, apart from this market related factors which impact the inequality of the wages, government facilitated initiatives can as well decrease or increase inequality. Policy makers and social scientists debate the effectiveness and relative merit of every strategy of inequality regulation. Typical initiatives of several governments that can reduce the growing gap betwen the rich and the poor include public education which can increase the skilled labor supply and reduce the income inequalities due to inequality in education.

81,2,2_93,"The rich are becoming richer evryday, and poor seem to die of hunger, poverty, poor living conditions. The rich class enjoys a magnificent  life with all the luxuries, on the contrary, the poor have to sustain their life on one meal a day or  sometimes without a grain for several days. The class difference is increasing day by day and there would be no end to this if it keeps building up with the same pace. This is happening because the poor are unable to fight back for their needs, even when they try they fall flat face, because they are no match to the power of the rich. The illiteracy among poor class is the main reason for this gap. The major part of population is poor class, and this class is deprieved of the basic rights which makes them suffer more and more. The government made RTE for the same cause, but the unawareness and improper implementaion is not helping in bridging the gap. The children who are even trying to educate themselves under RTE, they are facing multiple issues in elite schools. These issues are not physical, infrastructural but, psychological. The complexes they face among rich class children is impacting their psychological well-being and normal growth. No one is concerned about these consequences. Facts claim majority of poor students who registered under RTE for education in elite schools are dropping out due to these reasons. In government schools, educational facilities are not effective at base level. If the government can take certain measures to employ standardized rules in education system wherein every child actually receives equal opportunities it might lead to some help. The psychological component, the inferiority complex, the degrading self-esteem and the low will power due to humongous .... on poor class is widening the gap. If rich class only provide moral support and accept the poor class, it can bridge the gap."

In societal issues like well being or general human development lack of wealth leads to poor quality of education, social services and even to the point of not being able to meet basic human rights.A social deppression is suppressed on the have nots of the society by the means of rejection of services, discrimination and many other issues.The remedy by the means of Communism has been followede by many countries but failed to give a sustaining result but later on in many emerging economies through many reforms by the govenment the this isue has been handled.Making doing business easier, secure jobs for the rural people, develoment inagricultural sector and creating jobs through industrialization has paved the way for reducing the gap between rich and poor.

The people who are imployed then also some times they are as disguised enemployed.The skills should be devloped with in the people so that they get job according to their skill their are various schemes which is brought by the government like NSDC( NATIONAL SKILL DEVLOPMENT CORPORATIONS).If the same thing goes then the future of the country will be not good. the country will suffer very drastically. the rich should also help the country by doing CSR(CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY).By opening school, colleges , training and devlpoment program. this will be a win win situation for both the country and the big businessman. and in return the goverment shoul provide various subsidery for the big business man.The people should also co-operate with the company when they are working most of the time they leave the job or they are not working the job they are provided. they people shold do their assigned work sincerly and with full mind and soul.

But there are some people who show differences butween them that they are rich and the other people who are poor than them this is happenning more in our society. Since there is nobody helping the poor so this makes more gap between poor and rich.beacuse every where they are making costs high so, the poor cannot feed their children with proper food but the people who are rich people are not having any problem. Since they are having enough money. Half of earth's wealth lies in the hands of one percent of its people while a quater of the population cannot feed itself a day's meal. If they reduce the cost of the products then the poor people can lead their life as the money of high percentage is in the hands of one poeple. Quater of the population cannot feed itself a day's meal.The people are all treated equally in the society. But because of money and wealth the people are divided into rich and poor this is makinf lot of differences between people and it is increasing gap betweeen rich and poor which is plaguing our society. Making so many differences between leads to this problem as i am rich and you are poor and there is nothing given to the poor people so the differences are more which is not good.

All the wealth lies in one percent hands, leaving behind nothing for village people.One of the major problem regarding this issue can be black money.Rich people are earning lots of black money, which could be anyway the money for those poor people.All the rich people are having their hundreds of accounts to secure their money. They have bundles of cash locked in their rooms. We have to take step to help these people for their betterment and country's as well. Indian PM Narendra Modi has taken a very good step regarding this by abolishing 1000 and 500 notes to acquire more and more black money as we can see million of economy is been credited to bank last week. But still we have to do a lot more in this direction. Governmentshould provide more and more emloyment for them, so that they can improve their living status. There are thousands of men who can't educate their children due to shortage of money, which probably increases the illiteracy rate of the country, which will ultimately stops any country to move to developed one from the developing country. There should be apartments made for them by government.As quarter of the population of world lies in lower class, with weak living conditions, we have to take steps to improve their condition, loosing them would be a great loss for the world as they are also the building blocks of the nation."

In the past time all people are same with the money and with the status , all have same food to eat and smae dress to wear, but in the modern age we create a gap between rich and poor man that a poor man can not buy food without money . some time ago a person are not too much poor, they can easily buy food with less money , and they can survive easily with their family , that is not possible now that they can't survive with their family in the present time because the cost of every item is so high to buy for a middle class man , a rich person can buy any thing with their money because they have alot of money to spent in the food and for all the comfort , a rich man travels with the first class seat in the train and otherside a poor man travels in general coach of a train , because rich man have a bulk of money to spent . So this is the gap between rich and poor man that is not acceptable for this time , if we want to reduce this problen from our society then we have to take more action against this problem.We have to take a action that the money is not a propery of a rich man, money is for everone and any person can take money for their health and wealth.so we have to create a plan for money scheduling in which all have same amount of money to spent ."
90,2,2_10,"Yes, there is an increasing gap between rich and poor which is plaguing our society today. this gap may be due to several reasons one of which iscorruption. Corruption is one of the main reason for the above problem. Poor people are lagging behind due to this. Corruption plays a very important role in various fields like education, politics, government sectors etc.....,where poor people feel very difficult n rich people are lying at the top. Iwould like tell about corruption in education system , which s very important for every individuals now a days in society. But as poor people are not able to afford money for the donation suggested most of them fail to educate them and get into work for their own shelter. Where as the rich people are able to afford seats in a better school which increases their life style as well. Here people with more money are treated well in society and also respected in our society. Important measures to be taken is to completely avoid corruption. In each and every fields like banking,education,hospitals there is huge increase with respect to money,this also causes gap between poor and rich. onr remedy is to reduce the cost of daily affordable things like provisions etc...Where even poor people can afford things and can have a better life style."

The first and formost cause is the Corruption which we can find in every corner of our country,every state,every city etc.The Rich people are more commited to this.I am not addressing the every rich citizen,but yes most of them they do.The gap beetween rich and poor is also been increasing.The things poor people have to bear even nowadays is debatable.They are the most critisied sectors.They are treated unequal at most instances.There is racism against them.They are not availed proper education.Even their daily food is questionable at times.To curb this First of all we should change our mindsets.We should treat everyone at equal grounds.We should see everyone as a human being first. its our responsibilty to bring changes regarding this.and we shuold be the initiative.because c"
92,2,2_302,"Increasing Gap Between Rich And Poor ........Yes, i agree with the statement ,because their is a huge gap between the rich people and the poor people.The rich people are becoming rich day by day and poor people are on the same track which is followed or continued...as poor people are not getting the fundings to start a new business or to do anything as compare to rich they are full of flesh of money or fundings to start anything they want.because of their contacts . Unemployment is the biggest reason that poor people are facing in the society or suffering from that . because they are unable to meet the basic resources . due to this countries gross domestic (GDP) is lacking behind .Rich people are full of attitude they dont want to do the things what their labourers are doing and it comes to the ego of rich people , that of poor people are willing to do anythings because to meet the daily meal for them as well for the family members of the employee .As poor people are working hard and not getting the remuneration according to that . the owner of manufacturing company or bussinessmen is getting high profits because of the work done by poor people .Making rich people richer wont make the country rich making the poor people or bringing the poor people to same line will make the country rich . As poor people should provided loans and government suppoprt to become the poor people to become rich or come up above poor people society.As in India as their is different society whwere poor people lives or stays their rich people not purchase the house because if he purchases the plot or land in that society the status of that people will come down..as same with the poor people if they want to purchase the house in rich society the rates will gbe high and they cant afford to buy it so the difference should be removed and all should be equally"

But the poor poeples are not try to maintain the relationship in rich peoples, that is we are in some self comlex such as money,education,culture etc.The poor and rich peoples have to maitain the good relation it help for the good coordination in the world. so in our society all familys are in self related and we not in the other poeples.

Getting job needs skill so try to focus on skill development program this will help poor people to getting job. The main reason behind this is job is less than people so we try to open small scale and large scale industry to provide jobs to needy people.

Gap between rich and poor is increasing day by day creating problems for poor to fulfill their basic necessaties like food shelter and clothing .Half of the Earth's wealth lies in the hand of one percent of its people thus creating problem for the rest to survive and to live a healthy lifestyle. the quarter of the population includes upper middle class lower middle class and the poor . Reasonof such plaguing in the society is unemployment , exploitation, women treated as second citizen, division of society on the basis of skin colour, tradition , country of origin, caste system , religion, illiteracy poor health conditions of citizens living in a society due to malnutrition .Poor gets trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty because of illiteracy and less opportunities available to him due to unawareness. In order to reduce the impact Govenment should play a major role by providing basic necessaties to the people living below poverty line so that there basic necessaties are taken care of by providing good infrastructure and good managemnt system laws rules and regulation we can reduce this gap between rich and poor. creation of new jobs would result in more and more of employment thus helping people to generate income from such sources . in order to increase the literacy level education system needs to be improved by opening new schools and by providing good elementary education in the schoolswhich would help in the betterement of the society. Rich should pay more taxes and help government for the betterment . They should also opt for and encourage people to join hand and work for social responsibilities that would hep for the welfare of the society .Our prime minister Mr. Narender Mdi has also taken major decisions in order to reduce the gap between rich and poor by demonitising high value currency notes of 500 and 1000 . People holding black money now have to pay a penalty of 200% . This step would result in reducing the gap between rich and poor and reuction in the inflation resulting in higher prices of the commodity . This step would help in boosting the indian economy and it would definitaley reduce the gap between rich and poor making life of pooe people worth living ."
99,2,2_386,"According to the current situation in the world the Rich becomes Richer everyday an poor becomes poorer day by day.So there becomes a gap between poor and rich in the whole world.Society is also affected by this as rich people consider poor people as slave. They also hier people as slave for work at there home and pay very less to them this is the one more reason why poor becomes pooper.Rich peoplehave there money for investment to earn money nut poopr person doesn't have money for investment.Poor have less amount of money thats why they also earn in small amount,if they have large amount of money they can also earn in large amount but this can't be possible.As in India from november 10 2016 ,all 500 and 1000 note currency is banned according to the order of PMO India Mr. Narendra Modi, he took his first step againt demonetization of black money.Mr. Modi wants to ban black money all over the India region ,and he also want to stop creating fake currency of 500 and 1000 note.He promise every citizen that he will gonna exchange money from banks .But people faced many problems in recent days as they doesn't have 100 rs note ,no one is ready for taking 500 or 1000 notes except petrol pump.By this step everyone believes that black money is going to stop now so the rich people is no longer rich and poor people can also competete in market now.As use of black money also plays role in gap of poor and rich. People having huge amount of black money invest in the market so the poor people unable to take stand of their products.REASON:-*Use of black money* People are ready to work on low wages* Poor are not ready to take risk* Government not taking actions* Poor are not aware of policies by GovernmentCONSEQUENCES:-*Poor becomes poorer and rich becomes richer day by dayThe statement  Half of earth's wealth lies in the hand of its people while a qurter of population cannot feed itself a day's meal  simply implies that poor people might not have thier daily meal but rich people are wasting a lot of resources."
100,2,2_288,"India is one of the fastest developing countries of the world.Despite that,it has many major problems to face like,poverty,unemployement,illitration etc.One of the major issue is the increasing gap between rich and poor.It has always been a serious problem in our country.Some people are sowealthy while others are not even able to feed themselves and their family.Not only India,other countries are also facing the same problem.According to a research,half of the earth's wealth lies in the hands of one percent of its people while a quarter of the population cannot feed itself a day's meal.One of the main reasons of this problem is inequality.One who is already rich,gets more and more opportunities to earn and the poor one is being suppressed.There should be a reservation quota for the poor ones,not for the backward castes.One other reason is illiteracy.One should suppress child labour and motivate childern and their parents for making the childern educated by sending them to schools.Morover,one should help needy.Like,we should try to buy stuffs like vegetables etc.from the poor selling it,if the stuff is healthy for consumption as we can't put our health at risk in order to help the needy.We should also avoid wasting food.Our govt.should make some schemes for the improvement of poor and should also make aware them of these schemes.There should not be a feeling of hatred for the poor,thry also have equal right.The government should make sure that every child is being educated.We too, should play the role of a responsible citizen and should make efforts to make our society a better society.The educated people can educate the children free of cost and help this world being educated.When literacy rate is increased,the employement rate will also be increased and this will lead to a poverty free society,a happy society."
101,2,2_105,"The main reason behind the increasing the gap between the rich and poor are price rise,corruption,taxes policies etc.The corruption is find out every where either in government sector or private sector.If you have any work to a government employee it can never finished by giving money to him. disparity between people exist in all societies for the simple reason that we are not born equal.someone born in rich family and someone is in poor.the unemployement is also a reason behind it. the population of our country is too much thar quater of it are not able to get daily meal. So there is a big problem. someone says money goes to one who already have money.Money makes money. if someone is poor how can he earn money.the way of getting money are very small so he is not able to earn money.While the rich have a no of ways to earn money. The society gives respect who are rich not poot,that makes the gap between the rich and poor. And day by day thai gaps are incresing becasuse rich people are busy to earn more money any how.But the resourses to earn money for a poor people are few so he stiil stay where hi is no of years ago. and rich people growup day by day.To reduce the gap between rich and poor we have to help poor.give him employment and provide a plateform to earn money. Rich person should have to provise employment relaxsation to poor people that they can live better life. government shoud have to make policies in favour of poor people and give them better opportunity to do better and earn more mony , so that they laveles the gap between rich and poor. government have to give reservation for poor people in government policies.that they can find a better way to earn money."
102,2,2_336,"I think is not the god but it is the second god after the original one. even at that time rich person becomes more richer and poor person becomes more poorer.because poor person doesnot have employment to earn their livings and the richer person have amount more than their needs.more than half of the population of our country lies below the poverty line they donot have shelter,food,clothes etc. our govt. should increase the efforts to increasethe employbility to the younger people so that the poverty of our country vanish .for this our govt. should open the indutries ,it parks to increase the employment and also open some universities to provide the quality education to students . because our education system is not so effective that the students passed out every year are not so much skillful to work in corporate world. due to this reason all the students dont get jobs after the degree.only few students something about 2% get jobs in corporate.most of the land lords and richer persons stocks the material which are in good demand in the market and sell them at such a higher prices and the poor people have to buy these items at that prices. due to this the rich people becomes richerand poor people becomes more poorer.even the poor people do not educate their childrens in good schools or colleges as a result of this they are not enough skilled as the demand od todays world.the remedy to overcome this is that the people which have more wealth than their need they give their wealth to some needy persons or poorer people , they donate their wealth to orphanage homes etc.and the most effective to remove poverty is by providing employment ."

105,2,2_243,"Now a days the gap between rich and poor people had largely increased in our society. The main reason is the unwillingness to pay the taxes to the government properly. Because of this government income is decreasing and the leaders are limited by this reduced budget to initiate new scheems to the removal of poverty. As the politicians are not spending the government income in proper way for the development of country people are not interested to pay the taxes, therefore black money forms. To avoid this politicians sholud leave their selfishness to some extent insted they should try to reduce the gap between rich and poor people in the country. According a latest survey half of earth's wealth lies in the hands of one percent of its people while a quarter of the population cannot feed itself a day's meal, because of greedyness of some of the people on this earth. A solution to this problem is to educate the people in their rights of living and also to decide the cost of their products or work. Thenonly this gap will reduced to a little. The government should forces thre banks to release the loans for establishment of small and medium scale industreis to the needy young and poor pepole besides the rich bussinessman. The rich people should also take the initiation for the economical development of poor people, who are working under their famileis for the decade, by helping them in finantially in the studies of their children. hence there is chance of bright future of next generation of poor people."

And the lesser mark student are get addmittion in good college. therefore p the graph of rich and poor people get increase because of corruption and concession issue.The poor people even not take one time meal in whole day. they do not have that much of enough money to buy a food. And rich people get more facility than poor people. it's not good to our society. then the rich people get more rich and poor people get more poor and the gap between then is get increasing day by day."

Todaypeople become selfish,they don't want to know the difficulties faced by the poor people and also they are not intrested in social activities.They don't have any helping mentalities to them.By this the poor people get more difficulties for feed meal.It leads to more deseases.but they don't have money to go for treatement.So the death rate become increased.The rich people waste vast amount of food &amp; money.but they don't remember there are a group of people in the society who don't have enough money &amp; food for their needs.We can avoid this problem by help poor people as we can.By helping them we get a fullfillment.and we can decrease the rate of poor people suffering from the difficulties.So engaged in social activities.Don't waste food .Only use food that we need.Because there are many people in our society who waiting for eateven the waste food items to avoid their hungry.When we throw each of our food items as waste,remember there were an owner for it for feed itself a day's meal."

The whole society is in the hand of rich persons thet are free to do anything whatever they want .In society almost few poor peoples are their who are able to feed itself but doing some littlecworks probably half of the population are not in condition to take meals or to survive in the society beacuse they are fully dominated by then rich persons inthe society even rich persons are not behaving well mannered with them because nof their living standard. Aleast government should focus more and more on poor peoples so that they can be able to survive in this dominating society. Varoius schemes and facilities should be provided to them so that possibilities of differences should be minimized. Workers are doing their workseffectively and efficiently but still they are not getting proper wages and working situation by which they are not able to survive itself and not in good condition to provide good meal to their family regularly.The are taking meal once time in a day because of less earning and they have no right to take actions against their boss because of chances of loosing their job .

110,2,2_190,"The Economic Condition of IndiaAs we all know that in this modern era we are facing problems in every step of living, be it an economical problem or problems on personal grounds. In this age, what we see is that powerful people are getting more powerful and those who are not able to cope with this pace are getting detatched with all the facilities provided. This is the current scenario of our century. It is an harsh truth that only one percent among us are powerful as they holdhalf of Earth's wealth, and the rest of our population are suffering in their everyday life due to the lack of power provided to them.The main reason for this maldistribution of power is mainly because still major population among us are illiterate and they don't know how to gather power. Moreover in the elections we see that the illiterate people are easily being fooled by the strong party workers. Even in different villages it is more common, where the poor illiterate people are being fooled and they are forced to pay double taxn or what the villagers really earned after their hard work. Another reason behind this is the disbelief among people that cause them a great trouble. Due to this false belief and mistrust, they might lose all their precious things. So it is really unfortunate that our economic status is not that good compared to other nations. The majority of our population are poor, they don't feed themselves properly, this lead to economic downpour of our nation. The economic condition should be such that everybody gets equal right in every aspect ofliving. The wealth should also be equally distributed so that everyone should move at a right pace and then we will be declared a developed country.The first job that should be taken into account is education, childrenshould be provided with education. Unless proper education is applied they were not be aware of the things which are good or bad for them. Through education they will be able to face the everyday challenges in a new way and might discover something which could be of immense help for the future generations to come. In this way the problems could be solved."

While the 20% of the world's population makes it through with less than 1% of the wealth.We see examples of this in life everyday, like in the temples: the rich go in and spend thousands on pooja and rituals while the beggars outside starve for the milk and fruits and food burnt or offered to the god.One of the issues increasing this uneven distribution of wealth is the issue of corruption. The rich corrupt officials demand bribes from the public,accumulating wealth. The public needs to spend more money on bribes than the actual workthey need to get done.But we can see this changing, a bit. Withthe demonitization of notes the Prime Minister aims to bring this down soon. As he aims tobetter theconditionofthe Indian economy.We do see the rich trying to make the world a better place too, not all are greedy money hoarders. We do see the rich making some serious contribution to the world. Like the chairman of Microsoft, through their bill and melinda gates foundation. Or akon's afrika. or our own salman khan's Being human foundation.I do think it is possible to bring a steady economic state through our own actions."

116,2,2_24,yes this is right statement that the increasing gap between rich and poor is plaguing our society today that is why our respected prime minister mr. narendra modi has blocked the notes of 500and 1000. Because due to corruption rich family is becoming more rich and poor family becoming more poor. So there is a requirement of closing old notes of 500 and 1000 to make lesser gap between rich and poor people.and due to this gap in our society education is also being affected. and another solution to decrease gap between rich and poor people is make school and colleges same for both people and there should be only one bord of exam for all.because if it is done then there will be equal education for both and by this we can make same competetion level for both and by this we can justify talent of both people by giving same education level. So by this there will not be difference between rich and poor people and it will not plague our society.for the second topic it is does not matter of that how many people is going to rule the world to provide food or any things . the matter is that how it is going to be ruled. So provide the facilities the people who can not feed itself a days meals . I do not mean that provide them food i mean that provide them jobs facility from that they can feed themselves itself by doing job. so by this we can help the people who can not feed itself a da

Mostly it varies from country to country. as we all now that money makes money so rich people always have oppurtunity to increase there wealth even without working. same on the other side poors are becoming poorer day by day just because of increasing rate of infaltion. they dont have enough savings through which they can generate more wealth nor they are receiving any kind of dearness allowances. rich people are usally business mens they make their business stand by making other people work. they make lot of money out of it . they directly or indirectlt recovers their money along with profits. by the time some of business became so large and with utmaost brand that there is no competitor in the market for them. they kind of play monoply in the market. and it is because they are selling something unique and they cannot be competed easliy. so there are some specific business person like microsoft , alibaba, zara, they r among richest citizens in world. they are enlarging their business day by day. so we can say that even they also have no idea how much they are capable of earning in a particular period wheras a middle class or lower class people know how much they are going to earn.if we talk about the remedies the only thing which can be suggested like people should come up with more creativity which can give fair competitions with these business tycoons. government should also come in between to grant help in the time of need. there shall be no monopoly in either of the business. special tax rates can be imposed on these 1% of people. the gap can only be bridged if governments of respective ccountries shall start taking some initiatives. equal oppurtutinities should be in access to wide variety of people."

Farmers are the backbone of the country and they work hard in their fields to feed us.It is very much shamefull to say that these farmers are making sucides because of their povertyand we just enjoying our lives by wasting food without knowing the efforts behind it.these people are ignoring the hardwork behind to cultivation of crops and just wandering behind wealth.Government should take measures to save the life of the poor and should provide the basic needs to them.they should be treated in a good manner because without them we will be in a level where we could not get food even for single time.we will be having lots ofmoney with us but will not have food for onetime
122,2,2_53,"Today we are facing the problem of increasing gap between rich and poor and is plaguing our society .Today rich people are getting benefits in every field . There are several examples we have right nw ,for example in educatin system only people who are very rich buy seats in the most of high profile colleges. And people who came from merit can't afford the money for buying seats for their children.Its also true that half of the earth's wealth lies n the hands of one percentage of its people while a quarter of the population cannot feed itself a day's meal. As ,we know India is fully dependent on the farmers .But today farmers are one of the important person who is feeling the heat right now .They can't afford food for their children there is no faculity available for them.They are fully in debt of others person.They get frustrated every now and then and they commit suicide.As ,we can see the current sucide cases there are 70 % farmers are there.To overcme of ths the government have to take strict action against them.First the government has to provide faculities that are neccessary for the farmers of India.they have to give preference on the basis of wealth.And also the goverment has to remove the caste reservation .It is also one of the important thing in the plaguing our society.Today,rich people are getting all the facuilities and poor are just feeling the pressure of increased in price of each useful and necessary things of daily life.The government is just increasng the price of everything ,but they are not understanding that it only affect the poors and middle class people only .It's not affecting the rich people.

123,2,2_338,"I believe that the major reason for the gap between rich and poor is unemploybility. Unemploybility which refers to not gtting paid after working or not willing to work. In our society, generally the rich people do not account for paying the taxes to government, which in return is not able to help poor. Also, now a days poor have made begging as a profession; they know that people orgovernment might help them then why to work.Another reason which I would thinkfor this gap is inequality. Inequality in our society can be easily seen as the people who are having political background tends to enjoy handsome amout of incomes when compared to those not having.Thirdly, I think out1% rich people of are society have 50% people who have inherited the money from their ancesters.The major consequenses of this can be that poor will always remain poor, their will be more competition between rich. There will more inequality, more biasing and thus more number of poor will not be able to take their proper meal. Other consequenses can also be like people who are not able to afford his basic needs might end up his life quitting, thus, more number of sucides might take place.Thus, to avoid a certain kind of situation government should take an initiative and launch schemes of helping out poor. But on up of that the major imapct would be done by people. It's people who will let the solution get successful i.e rich start paying taxes, poor start for searching jobs, people loose their ego and a feeling of brotherhood and humanity flourish."
124,2,2_125,"The increasing gap between rich and poor is plaguing our society todayThe increase in gap is due to the problems like corruption,unemployment,increase in population,lack of education.Because the poor people wont have a money to send their children to the good schools by which they wont get a updated knowledge so tat they cannot compitate with others and bring themselves forward.As therich people provide good schooling for their children and these children will get updated to new technologies and give a healthy competitions and conquer to built their own offices and goes on developing their own companies.Without the proper education the poor people wont get a job for more salary whereas with the updated knowledge and education the rich will go on being rich.And also by the money power the rich people wont leave poor to overcome them.To eradicate the difference between rich and poor the government should take care to provide good education,eradicate corruption,and conduct awareness programmes on family planing,should also provide jobs for all eligible persons,loans of low rate of interest,and give encourangement of new innovative ideas,some programmes should be conducted on using new techinques so that the people can use and get updated to the technology."

126,2,2_335,"If we consider todays condition then the most effective counter move is assigned by honourable Prime minister Modi sir .Hence the differance causing major factor is black money , due to which the rich persons get richer &amp; poor persons gets poorer. The exchange of currency notes ids a better economical option provided by our honourable prime minister.If The money stored comes out then it can be utilized for public interferes, the tax and the daily needs values will get deacreased accordingly. It's hard to execute such plans but it is an economical efficient way to represent the way to fill the gap in between poor and rich peoples. The reasons are many causing due to which this gap increases , black money , improper goverment policies , the bribes and many more things. The rich people consume all the profit and money without paying the tax by giving bribes and many other ways hence goverment does not receives the tax. Due to this government is at loss and tends to increase the taxes and valuation of basic needs.The effective remedies on such problems can be provided by us only. For an example a common man gives near about spends 20 lakhs on black money given to builder , land officials and to government officials. If we consider INDIA only then imagine billion of people with this amount hence if the common man will stop givivng bribes and protest against it then only the bribe takers can be eliminated.Hence all those money can be used for various policies. Its the best remedy i can think about common man and government."

Rich people waste their money to at in rsturents, malls, etc.In India there are so money millioners but 70% of Indain people are so poor that they can not afford one time daily meelfor their family. The government must help them by giving them differnt kinds of jobs. The indian peoples are so busy in their daily life they don't even think about the poor pelople. We must investigate where the all money goes. Why they can't get their rights. today I saw girl of 3 years begging in train. After seeing this I fell like crying. I gave her 5 rupees and peoples on the train laughing on me. This is what we need to change. But it is everyones view how want to help poor people.Rich people getting richer and poor gettin poorer.Poor people whom are begging in the street they must find a job or do some wor for their daily meal. The people with two hand and two legs can do many thing but they only beg. so how it can possible that someone give them work to do. they must try to do something with their life other wise full time they have to do only begging.I proud to be an Indian but when i see this poverty, begging it is very shameful ."
142,2,2_87,"The topic given to me The increasing gap betwwen rich and poor is plaguing our society today. Yes, I agree with this statement. A society is called good, if there is no gap between poor and rich. Rich people have feelings like they are grater in the society. Some of them won't talk with poor, thinking that it's shame. They treat them like slaves. This is the way , the rich people do with the poor if there is huge gap between the both.           Poor people are also human beings. They may behind in earning but they are very much rich in human values. The rich have to be polite with them. One can not predict what happens very next moment. A person becomes rich only because of poor. If a poor didn't work in a rich's shop or company, how can he earns money and becomes rich. If all are rich who is going to work.          So, there should not be a coniderable gap between rich and poor. Sometimes it may leads to clash between them. That is not the way of behaving with human beings. Every one in the society is responsible for the ongoings in society. So, let us not to do that one, we should build a healthy society which will results for helthy nation."
143,2,2_310,In today's life there is a large gap between rich and poor people. The difference between rich &amp; poor people plague our society. The reason is that poor people have more money to exapand their idea to do something.I think we need to help the poor people at our level to help them to do something. They work at a hard level but they not earn more money to fullfill their needs in every day life &amp; their needs of their family &amp; children. Industries in india develop day by day and make in india plan is also good plan to develop our country. But when develop the life of poor person.I think we need to also concentrate on the lives of poor people. Many poor people they don't have food to eat...whereas rich person eat burger &amp; pizza..one have no cloth to wear &amp; one buy cloth daily.How these differeces will be less. We think more about this problem to help them and also to develop their lives. Some poor people have no work to do if we they will provide the work.May be there lives will better tomorrow.

145,3,3_337,"I can say we havepartially become the slave of technology. But through technology human beingcan do their work easily and acurately. With the help of technology the life of human being has become very easy. Now through technology human can communicate to each other any time from any place they wan't .Through technology the manual work of the human is also decreased. As every machine has been automated with evolution of technology because of which the time consumption to make any product is also decreased. Now, the product are available in the market at much lower price than earlier. But their is adverse affect of the techology also. Now human are more dependent over the technology rather than doing the work mannually. Our own creation are making us their salve, we can take the example of mobile phones wheather we have the use of it or not we always want the best phone with new technogy and greater no of features, sometimes we don't even know about all the feature of the gadget but we still want it. People use vehicle even for going to the person place living in the next street, human are less concernabout the pollution their vehicle creating and their long term and short term effects. Human care more about their ease, because of which the global warming is increasing day by day.Human are creating new technology at the name of innovation to make our life more simple. Yes, I do agree that use of technogy make our life easy, but because of this easyness we are becoming more and more lazy, and becoming more dependent over the technology. Now, human even to move small object form desk to another for thein own personal use, uses robot hands, so that they dont have to stand up walk and grab that thing. human are getting dependent over the technology even for their day to day work wheather we talk about making the list of grocerry, or power switch off. We wan't all to be done automatically and at exact time wheather we even remember to instrust the machine or not. so yes human are becoming slave of their own creation"

It also affects our brains by using of computer and calculators.firstly, the calculators were developed to help large mathematicals arithmatic problem, now due to technology scientic calculator has made very less use of brain by solving trinometry problem and also guides for shortcut methods.Use of spell checkers has made the vocabulary of humars worst due to not remembering of whole spellings, and also invades in pronounsation."

Such as later we have no smartphones we used letter for communicating to the peoples to different places but now we have smartphones through which we can not only talk we can make video call throughout the world. We have washing machines which provide less amount of work to do in washing clothes. we have metro trainins which are very fast this plays a very important role in travelling in the cities. In addition to this we have lots of technologies which can make our daily life easier and faster. But becoming slaves to them is not good. Let us take an example the young generation keep busy in thier smartphones they don't know what is happening in the world, small childrens uses mobile phones which is very harmful to them. We are also getting lazy towards our work like we use motorbikes even for a small distance. In this way we are loosing our own creation. Is we want to move forward in technology then definitely it requires our creativeness but now we are loosing our creativity. Because there are lots of tools through which we can do our particular task very easily. But if we dont do this by our own creation atleast a single time then how can we improve this. We are getting totally dependent on the technical equipments and services. We have to remove our lazyness due to these technologies sometimes we have to do our work with our own creativity through which new ideas came into exixtance which may be beneficial not only for the individuals but for the whole world. Use of Technology is good but excess use of this may voilate our thinking power, creativeness, awareness, exploring poweretc."

Instead of playing outdoor games, they prefer playing technical games on mobiles. But because of evolving technology communiaction has become very efficient. At right place, the right technology need to be used. We are misusing the technology. Technologies will keep evloving but we should know the correct use of technology.Humans are creating some excellent technologies world wide, but we humans are only making the misuse of it and it has become part of our life. We used to restrict ourselves from use of technology. One day if we don't get internet range, we become so restless. Yes! It is true, to some extend we are becoming slaves of our own invented technologies.New technologies helps us to a great extend to solve our every problem. But then we humans are becoming too lazy to solve minor problems. We order everything online, shop online, everything is at our door step. All because of technology(internet).

149,3,3_341,"I agreed totally with the statement that technology has become a new addiction for all kinds of age groups. There is mentality in every persons' mind that without technology, there is no life . But this is somehow true . Without it , we can not develop more. It becomes the essential part of our life . It has many benefits like we can learn anything by sitting in our homes , we donot have to go outside to complete our work as we can shop the things through online websites . Moreover , we can pay bills through respective online sites .As we all know that everything has its own advantages and disadvantages . Technology has many benefits too . It depends upon us that we are misusing it or becoming its slave . Most of the population in this modern era become slaves of it as they are very addicted to it which is not good . As it affects not only our health but also wastes our time. When we stick to our mobiles continuously , it affects our eyes . Our headache is going to start normally . By analyzing these points , we can say that technology affects badly to our health. It wastes our time also as we neglect our main work sometimes as we are too busy in seeing our favourite shows , chattng and posting our pictures and stuff ,playing games etc. As we find this more interesting than any other thing . People specially teenagers are more addicted to technology . They can not even live without it for one day . It majorly effects to their studies . Teenagers believe doing in machine work now -a -days. They are lacking behind in manual working which leads to weakness in their health . As they are not strong physically .I conclude by saying that technology is very important for us . But we have to use it systematically not affecting our important works . We donot have to wholly depend on technology . We have to do upgrade ourselves and maintain ourselves mentally and physically fit .We do not become a slave of anything ."
150,3,3_197,"Technology has become a need of the hour.With changing time,its quite necessary to replace old technique with the new one otherwise backward technology may become a significant reason for the downfall of the business.Old technique in business may result in huge costs and reduced profit margins,so there is no other option rather than to opt new technology.One can infer that we have become slaves of new technology.When we are using old technique and a new competitor enters the market with new technology,he would be given preference because he could manufacture more products in less time and increased profits.So it becomes costly for us to opt old technology.Its better that new technology should be welcomed. Let us take a simple example from the past information,though its not related to the corporate world.Firstly farmers were using manures in agriculture for increasing fertility of the land.Later on,High yielding Variety of seeds and fertilisers were used which were a sort of modern technology in agriculture.The farmers by using HYV seeds reaped huge profits in less span of time whereas farmers using the obsolete technology faced huge losses.Though we dont want to but we have to become slaves of the modern technology.     Similarly,it happens in every phase of the business.After removal of barriers in the industry in 1991,by using of LPG policy i.e.LIBERALISATION,PRIVATISATION and GLOBALISATION ,various competitors are entering the market.We are not aware of the latest techniques because we are a developing nation .They bring modern technology which provide them the benefit of reduced costs as well as increasing profits.This provide huge losses to the domestic manufacturers and they also try to import new technology.New technology provides multiple benefits to the business such as increased productivity,reduced costs and increased profits.So,it will not be wrong to say that technology,our own creation has become an addiction."

Mobile phones, video games, internet, television, tablet and notebooks are keeping a human being busy in virtual world. Though technology changed our lives for better living, it is also showing adverse effect on the other side.Technology addiction is new and is far more addictive than gambling or drug addiction. There has been a heated dispute whether there is a tablet user or computer user. Technology is very much additictive for young generation rather than playing cricket. The craving for the use of technology has termed different categories in the addition. A human system has been designed in such a way that it is rewarded each time it receives what is craves for. During this stage, brain releases dopamine, which is neurotransmitter and fills in the craving. Oviously there is a stronger debate about the usage of technology. One part of the community states that over usage of technology is for the moment where others say that it helps fulfillthe release of dopamine that plays a major role in decreasing the level of craving.Technology addictions are plenty and it is necessary to point out to the basic to over come the same.

160,3,3_223,"Technology - a new addiction.Technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purpose. Technology can be defined as the knowledge of techniques,processes or it can be embedded in machines, computers, devices and factories which can be operated by individuals without detailed knowledge of the working of such things. Technology is something which makes life easier and luxurious. However, technolgy has become a new addiction.It is not surprising, considering childrenbetweenage 8 to 18 spend an average 7 hours per day using such devices. According to a report, about 90 percent of the teens send 100 or more messages per day. One study participant described sending a text message evry minute or so and felt ashamed for not being able to go 24 hours without a cellphone. Even more damaging than occupying the time of teenagers is the potential effect so much technology might have on how children develop. It can not be disagreed that humans, the creator of technology, are becoming the slave of technology. It can be seen that due to technology, we talk more through texting or messaging and less through face to face interaction, which are important for social and emotional skills, such as reading body language or feeling empathy. Today, everyone can be seen busy with their phones or gadgets. Thus we have become slaves to our own creation. Technology has become so vast that we can not go even a day without it. One can be seen busy watching television all day. We can not disagree that technology has made life easire but we must admit that technology has made humans it's slaves. Earlier people were busy interacting with each other by talking, but today people can be seen busy with their devices or gadgets. Today, it can be seen people interact less through face to face talking and more through text messages.Thus, considering all the facts, we can conclude that humans, who created technology, has become the slaves of technology. There is no denying the fact that technology has become a new addiction."

There is no such place where we are not using technology nowadys.Even the master hires slaves so that he can reduce his workload and his time can be saved.I partially agree with this statement because we are dependent on technology.We cannot say that we are slaves of our creation because a creator cannot be a slave.In the same way we,human beings are the cretors of technology.We have created it to help us reduce our work and do things with ease and more comfort"
163,3,3_18,"yes, we have become slaves of techonology, and also we are moving ahead of inventing or creatiing things according to our needs. i am in a very much favour of this things, that mans has starting creating things or techonology according to there need. as man can fullfill thear need in easy or in simple manners. there are daily new inventions are made by man to make life simple, and thing beyond our expectation. i am disagree with the truth that our new generation is totally now a days dependent on techonology. they are not capable of doing tings according to them with out the help of new techonology, as if thiss will continue, in the comming time, the future will totally dependent on the techonologys and the robots. my concern is regarding that if in future techonology failure take place, the world will be in a big problem, as they are habbitual of doing things with the help of techonology. in my view we should use the techonology in many aspact, it is gud, but we shouls not become habbitual of techonology. we shouls also know the direction to do work without the help of techonology. as in the age of mobile communication, it is very usefull for transferring data and many stuff. so according to me we should involve in techonology, but should also learn another alternative as if some time techonology falior take place."
164,3,3_118,"This is a very bigproblem in todays era.People using technologies every days.Yes according to me technology become a new addiction in now days era.We have become slaves of technologies,which are created by us.People become lazy due to the technology,they do not want to do any problem by their own self,they takes help of technologies to do anything.Even people take help of technology to calculate very easy calculations like addition of two numbers.People are not able to do hard work due to tese technologies,although technologies are very importent in some fields but people use technology in each field this is a bad thing.Due to these technologies many accedents occured day by day.People using high speed cars,bikes,truck etc any accedents occured.Many people killed by these accedents some enjured due to these technologies.If we talk about cultivation then productivity of fields also decreases day by day due to these technologies.It is a big problem for whole world.Due to tese technologies polution also increases day by day.People are suffering from many different different diseases whose medicians are not available in the market,It increases the death rate in the society.So we can say that these technologies also harmful for ournation.People are become habitual to these technologies.They always sticks with the computer systems they forget the importance of nature.People stopped to come in the fields to play any game they always playing computer games,they always busy in surfing internet.they busy in social media sites like facebook,gmail,linkedin whatsapp etc.people dependent on the technologies they do not want to do any work by their own self,they always take help of technologies for example if they want to go for purchaging any thing from market they cover the distance from home to market either by bus or by car or by bike they do not want to go there by walk so i think it is harmful for their helth also.these technologies produsing many different different diseases also like dumb,headech,bliendness etc.Although these tchnologies created by human although then these technologies are harmful."
165,3,3_359,"Has Technology Become A New AddictionIn today's era the human being become the slaves of technology rather doing the work by their own hands.As human beings started depending on technology to do little things as if they don't like to go and stand in queues anymore they have started paying online payments of their bills,mobie tickets etc. Just because of technology human beings have lost there concentrating power as they only search on the search engins not through by there own. Researchers have made their thoery that a human can't rely on on thing not more than 18 sec as if a man scrolling down the facebook he/she will get bored only in 18 sec and he/she will move to someother thing like instagram or whatsapp.People used to restrict themselves in those technology as small children used to go out nad play outdoor games like cricket, badminton etc. but now they used to play all these games on there mobiles or on there tablets. Just because of exces use of technology people are playing with there health. Just because of excess use of computers and laptops people become a sufferer of migran,headaches amnd their eyesight might get affected in the early stages.Technology also increased the unempolyment problem in the nation as the person who have the knowledge of the newest tecnology they get the job easily and who don't have the proper knowledge they are sitting idle at ther homes.Technology also has emerged there impact on the workings of the industries as they used to make there products production process effective by using the latest techonolgies.In the last yes technology has an addiction on human minds and it increasing on a increasing rate day by day as the new inventions are coming rapidly in the present."
166,3,3_60,"Yes i definately agree with the statement we have become slaves of technology.Because nowadays in the generation of 21st century,the technology has grown very much faster and everyone of us is leading life with the support of technology.Technology has become the daily need of each and every human.Technology is daily need of human and it is very useful because without technology life will be hell.Technology reduces the man work and helps man leading a stressful life.With the help of technology all human beings stay connected with eachother and lead a joyful life.Technology is must in the 21st generation, but it should not become an habit,because if we make technology as an habit then we will be considered as slaves of technology indirectly.We should not depend on technology for each and every basic need.We should not misuse the technology.We must use technology only when it is needed ,but we should never make it as an habit.We should not get addicted to technology and become its slaves.It may effect on our presence of mind.Ofcourse i know that we cannot lead our life without technology, but still we should use technology for good things and for betterment of our lives instead of using it for bad purposes."
167,3,3_305,"In this 21th century science and technology has become part of our day to day life.In this modertn generation everyone should be adicted to the nearest technology.Almost people are adicted with mobile phones.They go to bed but can't sleep or fall asleep exhausted and wake up tired.Peop[le could switch their brains off.Surely people could not switch off their phones.It should be very harmful for our health.It causes brain canser.Next generation canser will come in every family.People use laptop or computer almost more of the time in a day.It should be very harmful.It causes eye problem.Surely tiredless is a by-product of a busy modern life children,work,hobbies etc.Our generation has not got the hang of how to respond to it so we respond very reactively.For a lot of people its the lack of offline time which causes hyper arousal of the brain,People walk about in a state of distracibily.Children are affected in video games.It should hamper their studies.Use of mobile and laptops has been increased witha rocating speed.Students should be very attentive in their studies.We see a decrease in memory and the mind is not developing. Technology is a wonderful thing if used properly. In the current generation those who remember the life before the internet for whom the technology is not irresistible. Agrees that technology has ruined the current position of human life. Our brains are good and adapting and they will continue doing that and the same has happened with the technology. It is so much into our lives that imagining a life without internet or technology is horrible. Having a cpu or tv is"
168,3,3_59,"Yes i do partially agree that each and every human has become a slave of technology but not totally,because technology has done a great magic like it has connected whole world by social sites and mobile communication,brought automations at industrial,domestical level etc.But has anybody thought that why it happening like this.In olden days there was absence of technology so people were having a very healthy and tension-free life.Each and every human was doing one and the other physical activity.Domestic activities like washing,grinding was carried out physically but in today's world it has been replaced by washing machine and grinders.Because of grinders and washing machine human's time,efforts has been saved it doesnot mean that we are its slaves. In olden times it was ok when only head of family was working even the rates of required things was reasonable,but today at current situation the family is supposed to be supported by both husband and wife in order to run the family.If today's woman thinks of doing all home activities manually it would be really difficult for her.If she wants to complete all household chores as well as she wants to work she has to get help from technology.If we use anything in excess,that thing doesnot has its importance.similiar is the connection between humans and technology.Technology has really brought a golden era in human's life,but it will become a hell if we doesn't use it in efficient and limited way. Some small and beneficial things should be must be initiated like we should not travel on private vehicles for short distances,should use social sites for maximum social work not for chatting,electronic devices should be used according to the purpose,instead of playing games on computer kids should play outdoor games and this thought should be given to children to their parents.technology is for and by the humans so be the master not slave of technology and use it for beneficialk"
169,3,3_194,Technology has become a new addiction. Now a days we are more dependent on technology. With the use of these technology we are creating our bright future. But it is also true that we have became slaves of technology. We created technology for our comfortable life but technology is rulling over our life. We are always dependent on technology. We cannot do any things without technology. Technology are used to make our life easy not to rule our life. Technology is very helpfull to do our daily needs but sometimes it becomes burden on us. Now a days we are so involved in technology that we cannot leave without technology. Technology must be used for making our life comfortable but we make technology out daily habit of leaving. Now a days we are very social by the use of technology we are friends of many unknown persons but in real life without technology we even do not know our own neighbours. Technology is very helpful in dealing with day by days problems but we must use technology for making our daily work easy. Sometimes we are completely dependent on technology because with the use of technology we get information from others very easily. If we were not dependent on technology then it takes a lot of time for getting the same information. Technology is very helpfull if taken in a right way but may be very harmful ifcompletely dependent on technology. Now a days we are adopting new technology as soon as it is available in the market for making our life comfortable. Technologies are used for helping ourself with the use of technology we save our time by not doing the hard works. We can completely relie on new technology which are launched in markets.
170,3,3_272,"It is very true that in the present world we all are surrounded by the technologies and different instruments as well as gadgets. Some of them are very useful for our daily life and have become an importantpart of our life also like mobile,television,fridge,bike,car,bus etc. But like all other things,thesethings also have some good and some badeffects on our life as well as our health.For an example,with the help of mobile we simply do conversation as well as take care of different things of our family and friends. But social media is also a great tool which comes under the banner of technology. No doubt that social media like facebook,twitter have a great impact on our daily life. But,it has some worst effect also.Like youths are spending more than enough time on these platforms which simply distract them from their real goal of life. But we simply can not blame these applications because they also provide useful information for our future and our daily life.Technology is every where. From a small niddle to metal tank,from our kitchen to war field it is all about new and attracting technology. Some where we are habituated of these things and without them we shall face a lot of problems. But these things are also important for us. To protect ourselvefrom enemies we need modern and latest technologies otherwise we shall become outdated.So,for some extent these things are good unless and untill we use them for good reason but technology becomes real and strongest enemy when goes into wrong hands.Without mobile,car,television or fridge our simple life will be affected to a great extent. So,it is very true that we all are addicted of technology but we should be also ready to handle our life without technology."
171,3,3_224,"TECHNOLOGY  Technology is the biggest achievement humans have ever made.In today's life,from pen's nip to pant's zip,everything is based on technology wheather it is basic or complicated.As the technology developed from years,it changed the human's lifestyle in many means, today sending a message to a person sitting miles away from you have became easy due the evolution of technology. As the technology evolved,it gave humans various modes to entertain themselves.From the invention of telegraph or telephones till the recent inventions like smart televisions,smart phones,every invention made humans to come much more closer to presence of technology.The lifestyles have changed due to the ease in life due to the technology present in surroundings. Humans day by day are becoming very lazy due the efficient services provided by technology. From school going childrens to adults,everyone is getting addicted to technology. Before the invention of computers,gaming consoles,etc. the children used to play the outdoor games which were related to there physical fitness during there free time. But in this generation of technology the children are getting addicted to the gaming consoles and hence the existence of traditional games like kabaddi, kho-kho which are played in some places is endangered now. Playing on gaming consoles is not wrong but getting addicted to it is not good for future generations as well as for present generation. Now lets talk about Adults,who are solely responsible for developement of their childrens.But in todays date,adults are themselves more addicted towards the new upcoming games and other technologies. Nowadays we can often see many office going mens and womens as well as the teenagers addicted to the social sites or social applications installed on their smartphones.So from every point of view,Yes the technology have became a new addiction for todays generation which can be harmful for future generations"
172,3,3_71,"Yes according to me technology become a new addiction.Technogy is nothing but creating some new technics.As I am a Mechanical Engineer many technologies are there for automobile.We has to accept the technologies which are beneficial for us. We should have the concept of it.We mustlearn technologies.For Mechanical Engineer there are many softwares for creation and analysis like CATIA, ANSYS,PROE, SOLID MODELING, AUTO CAD , AUTODESK,etc.       If we do any practical project regarding the technology we can bettter understand it. In last year we had done a project on Quad Bike in which we learn the technologies regarding how to do it. I am agree to technogy is addiction. Once the technogy is made for some reasons it can be used for more time.Witn the technogy base we can invent many things.       We are getting attracted to some new things likewise we should take interest in technoogy. By inventing small things we can make more change. According to me we are somewhat slaves of technology.If we are not getting answers to any textbook question then, we are dependent on net we are not thinking about that situation.Hence we are somewhat slaves of technology. And in some cases light of our home hadgone then, we think that when light will come we will study.So, we are fullly dependent on technology. We should not be fullydependent on technology.      There are many reasons were we are dependent on technology. Hence we come to conclusion that we are addicted to the technologies."
173,3,3_319,"In modern era, technology is playing very important role in everyone's life. Today's world we can say as a digital world because we can access many things online and we can also pay many bills online and this is all possible due to the advanced technology. it helps us in getting through many important details or what is happening around us. Government of India also welcoming the new and advanced technology for the betterment growth of the indians and also make many changes in the previous technology, Mr. Nariender Modi also named the scheme known as 'DIGITAL INDIA' which helps India to grow and live life at ease.Digital marketing is helpful to the economy in many ways like it helps people to get rid of handlling so many bills because they get it on mail as their are many online shopping applications are their which provides many bills online, it will help government to check on a person who are paying taxes, the education syestem in schools and colleges is digital system. We can go though many sites and applications, go to any place with the help of GPS system. In this way technology is helping the economy as well as the world.Technology on the other hand is also not so good as we are getting more and more dependent on technology which is not good for us and also stops are mind to think because we get all details online, many small children spends lots of time playing games online which stops them to go out and play outdoors games, they love to sit alone and passing their time by searching out wasteful activities.In this way technology is both good as well as bad as it has many benefits as well as disadvantages. So we can say taht use of technology in a limited manner is good but depending wholly on technology will lead you"
174,3,3_54,Yes technology has become a new addiction because todays children are spending more time on mobile phones telivisions laptops and various more technologies so its very harmful to human beings . the doctors says that the person using more mobiles and technology driven things they are syco and gets angry more often. Moreover the children also sticks to such technology and are becoming more lazy this is a very bad thng which will not let us to grow fast andd we will not become a delope nation very fast. due to these technologies the peoples are not coming out of their houses and are doing things stting in their houses. The lazyness of the peoples is making them suffring from diseases more often then hearing aids which we are using are making peoples suffring from headaches and many more mental problems. this has also led india to come below thw developing country. these effects would become serious in future.
175,3,3_147,"Technology is what we humans have created out of our creativity and curiosity . From time to time the need and changing behaviour of human psychology forces we humans to invent new methods and products for the sipmlicity and easy lifestyle.As they say Neccessity is the mother of invention , .from computers of size of rooms to the mobilles we are using today technology have changed the lifestyle of every individual living in the in modern times.There used to be a time when people could solve complicated mathematical and scientific problems using paper and pens only , now with the boom of technology people have become dumb to such an extent that the students if given the problem to be sovled google comes to rescue rather than using his owm mental ability. Likewise if we talk about the food industry every organic food is available in supermarkets cleaned and half cooked , it did made our lives easier but if we look at its darker side food preservatives and lack of knowledge of the origin of food may leave us hand folded , in case any distruption in the food production chain happens.With every new discovery and invention life indeed became easier to live but we humans the makers of the gadgets and teachnology have became slaves of it . If you would ask a person ,can he not use his /her mobile phone for 24 hours ? The answer would surprise you because every individual has became so much dependent on mobile phones that even we do not forget to take it to bathrooms .There is a famous qoute , quoted by ALBERT EINSTIEN -technology will grow to such an extent that it will halt the human interaction . Take the example of social media (whatts app , facebook etc)- people prefer talking to the unknown persons in some part of this world rather than thier own family members and neighbours which depicts the the darker impact of technology on our socail lives and personal lives too."
176,3,3_33,"Yes, nowadays Technology has became a new addiction. Absolutely we have became slave of technology, our own creation. Somehow and somewhere in our life we have became fully dependent on the technology kind of things. Technology is the future and kids are the future. Teenagers love to use technology because it is like breathing for a teenager's soul. It is said that an average of teens recieve more than one thousand text everyday. Some have said texting is good for you, but other have said is mind numbering for the teenagers to mind to spend alltheir time texting. Being technocrazy is good but using it for fun kind of thing has adverseimpact on lifestyle. There have been debates saying teenagers don't spend enough time with their families due to excessive use of technology. As Krystle sng says i9n her article , For some people, the main appeal of the iPod is that it preoccupies you so you are no longer obligated to interact with uncontrollable factors of daily life. Visible from a good distance away, white earphones signal one thing to most people : don't bother trying to talk to me. iPods are major deterrent signal to conversation , with it becoming increasingly acceptedable to converse while still listening to the ipods.Other says the internet gives socially awakened people the ability to feel more comfortable and make it easier to keep in touch with freinds and family. i say that is disagreeable to me in my opinion. First of all there are internet predetors out there looking for kids to talk to. The internet and technology is not always safe to use. Anybody could have fake identity on the internet. Many of them just want to meet the kids to harass them. They spend more time on internet to cheat."
177,3,3_314,"In our day to day life, from the early morning to the bed time technology is the main part in our life. When we do rise in the morning, the alarm clock helps us in a great way as well as when are going to sleep at night the air condition machine helps us to sleep throughout the night without any disturb from the temperature. We can say this is the helping hand of the technology.Without the technology this is not possible in our day to day living the life. Going to describe is technology become a new addiction, the major example in front of our eyes is the 'mobile phone'. The mobile phone helping us in many way like to communicate with others, to get the news of the world on the go by internet, to use the pnone as alarm clock, as calculator etc. But on the other hand, we the current generation slowly get addicted by the mobile phone in many way. Lets consider the example of robot. The robot is used in our manufacturing industry now a days rapidly. By the use of robotics manufacturing of larger and greater number of goods is easy today. recently the human beings are going to mars and moon and space by the use of current technology. But on the other hand the robot is missusing now a days . it is not good for the human beings. bad persons for the society goping to fulfin his own thing. but it is not good. it is harmful for us .it is very addictaed for the human"
178,3,3_218,"TECHNOLOGY A SMART WORLD As the world is nowadays in the advanced stages of life, Technology has played a very big role for the development of surrounding. As new technology's came to u day by day we had now going step by step ahead to reach all the comforts and advanced methods for serving our life in a very intresting and easy way without getting any work to do. As there is an advancement in technology simultaneously there is a very big problem that people are nowadays fully dependent on this advanced technology and this will cause a serious troubble in upcoming time. people are addicted towards this technology and are day by day getting more addicted towards this due to which people are getting more and more dependent on this technology. Due to this advancement in technology upcoming generation is fully dependent on this advanced technology. The technology is just to make our work simple and do it in a better way but people are now fully getting dependent on this due to which various diseases arising now. As we know that our body remains healthy only when we do work. I would like to add a statement that WE ONLY CREATED THIS TECHNOLOGY AND NOW WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THIS TECHNOLOGY . Not persuing our work and being dependent on machines would make us slaves of our own creation. It is we that we made this advanced technology for the betterment of people and society but now people are using this somuch that it is causing harm to them. This technology has being addictive only for the upcoming generation who just want to spend their previous time by wasting but technology has always helped us in all ways of our life and also for the society. Atlast I will only conclude that this Technology is always helping us in all stages of life and we should not be fully dependent on this this technology. We should use this technology in an efficientt and positive manner which will in return make us feel happy and society too."
179,3,3_386,"As we know various technologies are taking birth due to the several new inventions of people. Human beings are the creator of technology and then they are also becoming the slaves of their creation. If we take an example of mobile phone, there are many applications in a single mobile phones like facebook and people are highly attracting towards it. We can see this example in the classrooms. Teachers are teaching and students are just chatting on mobile phones with their friends. The scenerio is changed now. At present, people can survive without food for a single day but they can not survive without multimedia phones. All these activities show that human beings are becoming slaves of their own creation. We have more technologies as compared to previous time. We have laptops, mobile phones, music system. New minds are creating new technologies everyday whether in the engineering field or in medical field. In medical field, we have such kinds of instrument which can easily detect breast cancer on their own. There is no need to take doctor help in this procedure. As the technologies are increasing, human beings are becoming lazy. In other words, we can say that they are more dependent on tecnologies. Ultrasoud, X-Ray are also the techonologies used in medical science. If we talk about the technologies used in engineering field. There are so many instruments based on different tecnologies are present like multimeter. We can come to know the values of different resistances using multimeter. When multimetr were not there, people were using the colour bands of resistances and then made calculations to know the values but now they are simply using electronic gadgets to make their work easy. This all activities harm the mental levels of human beings. Earlier, they had a habbit to learn the things but now they are adddicted towards the technologies. Technology increases the smart work but also reduces the hard work. Due to increasing technolgies, employment reduces exponentially. People are becoming slaves because they are using technology in their every steps of life. Calculator is the electonic gadgets used for calculations. Students use it even for small calculations. All these things show that people are getting trapped in their own creation."
180,3,3_63,"Yes i agree with this.Technology has become a new addiction.As we know thatchange is the law of nature.Change for any positive betterment is good.But excess of everthing is bad.In today's era everyone is running toward's the new technology.They don't use their minds for any new creations.People dontuse new technology for new creations.They use only predefined technology for their work.As we know that india is a developingcountry not a developed country.In india people focus on those technology that they know already.They don't focus on new technology which make thier work more easier.Due to this they have becomea slaves of this technology.There are various areas where people can explore their knowledge but they don't use new technology n new creations, they use only predefined knowledge for the completion of work.Due to this reason only our india is a developing country.In india people only focus on earning money not on new technology.As many students having high creativity can't expose because of their tight college schedule.Even as a student of btech i feel there are various areas where i can explore but being not part of the curriculumi found it difficulty to manage it.We can take a example of electricity all people in this world is totally dependent on it.Without electricity people survival is very difficult.In today's world people wants to live comfortable life due to this people have become slaves of technology.We take another example mobile,mobile has made human life day by day easier.Without mobile human survival on this world is difficult.Mobile has palys a very important role in making the people slaves of technology."
181,3,3_405,"'Has Technology become a new addiction?' it is thequestion which every individual today is asking to himself. Where ever we go , when ever we go we need mobiles,internet connection,laptops and what not. If data connection is lostpeople behave like that the air or water is gone ,they can't survive now,death is coming for them ,these are some reactions I personally experienced from my surrounding.No doubt technology made our life faster and much easier now we don't have to go to well to fetch water or to send a message to other state need not to wait for days . We are devloping with amazing speed just because of our one creation TECHNOLOGY.We went to moon,mars and in depth of oceans to know more and more. Its exciting how you can become happy in instance of time, like if you are away from home you can send message or call to your home .We surely have become slaves of technology ,our own creation but what to do now. If electricity in my home goes I feel like I went to stone age ,I can't live without electricity for more than an hour that also if I have other sources like mobile phone or laptop something like that to pass my time with.Ask a student to write an assignment and he/she will ask the you the first question 'Can Imail it? or bringprint out of it?' like writing is some tedious or stone aged work .Every one like to run ,fast pace of life excites them give them feeling of development but what this development is doing to us nobody have time to think about it.We are surrounded by gadgets which I guess can do anything from making food to cleaning utensils,we made them torun on our fingersand do what we want but now opposite is happening ,they moving us around in there commands.I like to conclude saying that its good that we have technology and we are achieving so much from it, but addiction of anything leads to destruction.We need to know how we can use something for betterment of ourself and society,how we can know the deepest secret of life ,of universe,we surely can do all this using technology but main thing we need to keep in mind is that it afterall is a creation only."
182,3,3_99,"We are living in an era where everyone involves, directly or indirectly, in different technologies. By using these technologies, our life became smoother but it does not mean that we have to depend on it or habituated for this. We all are using social networking sites.It's a good thing to be in touch with friends and relatives but now day we are blindly depend on it.Our young generation spoiling their time,not be in touch,but in different manner which is not good for our next generation.One side social networking sites help the people to connect them while other side it is also a reason for divorce,breakup and many other things. Yes, technology makes our life easier but we can never refuse that it is also a reason of many problems. I am not against of technology, but we have to see the truth that in which manner we are using these technologies. Parent should take care of their children that for what purpose they are using these technologies.Technology become addiction. Though it is our creation but now we can feel that we have become a slaves of technology. We are habituated in such manner so that we can do even a single work without their presence. Our daily life become inactive if these technologies will not be there.We start our morning with social networking sites which kills our golden morning time.In 24 hours a normal youngster spends approx 5 to 6 hours on these social networking sites.We are so habituated so that for every single query we search it on Google. We never try to spend some times and take stress and find out our own solution.In future,if these situation will be still there then i can say that our next generation well be slaves of these technology and their own mind will be disabled."
183,3,3_166,"Technology is just a force multiplier.Force multiplier in the sense that it helps us to increase our computational reaches and there by helping us to establish bigger and bigger economies, social administrationsystemsandpublic awarness. It has made us capable of reaching moon and then returning back to the earth.i find it quit uneasy to think that we have grown into the slaves of technology . why? becouse it's just an outcome of negative thoughts. a very sound example to put forward in this context is though technology has grown so much, still a man operates it at his wish and it is he himself that keeps innovating technologies and making the older technologies obsolate. So this point makes aman likegod with respect to machines. so how come we became its slave?There is very urgent need to distinguish between the amount and extent of the use of technologiesin our daily life and it becomming a intense part of our life that we can not quit.yes i understand that some people take it too far, like playing video games for weeks and weeks and unaware of outer world. yes i can undestand that we can not go to moon without our technologies but tell me other way if you have? If human civilization is to grow and become a space civilization , we will have to use technology. And using a technology, which actually is an idea from human mind itself, does not makes human a slave of technology. Instead i see it as setting the higer level of intelligance in bigger mass of humans, which will ultimately pave the path for human civilization to become a space civillization. And this should be our firstgoal for humanity as race to survive the cosmic time lapses and continue our journey of life."
184,3,3_345,"i agree that technology has made us slaves of itself but i do not compaletely agree to this. i have a diplomatic veiw point towards this topic. this is so because if technology has itsdisadvantages, technology has its own advantages too. technology has indeed made us the slaves but it has made our life easier too. technology like the internet has made it nearlyeasier for us to not know nothing and learn new things. it has simplified our life and is less time consumiung but it has made us equally lethargic too and entirely depenedent on it. technology has become an addiction as every person out there is dependent on it for its work to be done. for instance, appearing for this exam is a part of the techgnology. if technology dint exist, appearing for an AMCATexam would have been nearly imposible. technology has created a world with possibilities but has even created a world with people misusing the very same technology fortheir undue advantanges. if on one hand trechnology has helped us develop the nation, it on the other hand even created shortcuts for the work to be done. indeed, technology has become an addiction but it has become for the best use of it but with a few disadvantages which can be overlooked but not entirely."
185,3,3_351,"Hello every one today i am going write about new technology. Yes i am fully setisfy that techology became a new addiction. U all know that india is dovelping countary and india want add on some new techology in past and old technology. when india got independance from english persons that time india had less tecnology but now a day india is changing all new things it' all because of new genration of india. India have 60 percente population of youth among all population of india . India is fastest country.We have become slaves of technology, with our own creation because of new technology. Before some time india was very poor in technology but now a days time is change with change of technology. India have a lot of enginners for chane and for new addition in technology. Whole word going on new technology. So new addition is very impotant for growth of india. Without rechnology we can not anything because it is very important for us. India have new genration of mobles , new genration of all new thing because of addition of technology.I belong from civil enginnering so now i want write some addition technology in civil enginnering field. Before some time Civil engineer did draw drafting on paper sheet but now a days wit new addition of new technology civil engineer can draw diagram og building using Auto-CAD software in 2D as well as in 3D. Before some time Civil engineer can not design any building with any software now he can do designing using Stadd Pro software. So there are mainy technology which is use in civil engineer.so by these all things we can say that we have slaves of technology . Technology is very important of and dovelping countary. Without Technology we can not do easy work.Thanks"

Technology has their very good,eficient uses;which very nnedgul for our mankind, and also for nature.Technology give lots of things.Its plays very crucial role in our life.Its gives more comfort.Technology is involved in ourevery work.Technology has no limits its now developed wireless,with wire.So many things are happening in modernizing technology.Today's world now based on their thechnology.Wvery nation is trying make their technology better and better;so thet they are not put back from being Developed coutries.This technolgy also bring lots of prolem with them.Old years people use manpower for their work.But because of Technology this manpower is replaced by machine power.Because Machine give productds at faster and accurate rate than humans.So man is literally depend on technogy.Man become slave of this technology.Man just want better life;for that man is depend on technogy.Todays technology has artificial intelligence.So they don't need human for their woks.This affect all human.But its enhance technology.Technogy bring soo many problems like,unemployement,electricity shortage,nature resources shortage,water consumption,soil quality degradation etc etc .Umployement is the biggest problem faceing by allover the world's Nations.Because of technogy more unemployement increses.Technogy needed lot of electricity for their.Its take too much resoursce than humans and other animals.Soil degradation is also the major probklem.The waastage of technogy is dumped in ground.This causes soil pollution.Water is also affected by this technogy.As we know every thing has both sides like good or bad.Technology has benifits too.Technology improve medical theropy.Because of that many people aree saved. Its also increase transport speed.NOw people can go all over of the world in minimum time.Technology plays crucial role in Security,National security.Technology"

The technologies which we are having are having both good and detrimental effects on our lives, but still we need them for our survival and exitence in smooth ways. Like in the field of medical science the technolgies which have came up are saving lives, people are getting cured. same in case of telecommunication services lots of hight tech mobile companies give high featured phones for multi tasking which is reducing stress of people in daily life as they can do their work anywhere and internet which has joined globally each and every corner of the world is apreciating. but in case of defense and bombs, the technologies are creating devastating impacts when they are in wrong hands. whereas the new structures or modern bridges or underground pipelines which are being created are marvellous and they show the progress of technology.In this way modern day technologieas are changing the lives of people we need them for our easy living. technology is changing the face of humankind. and the newer one the Artificial intelligence technology on which works are going on is a area of huge development of human lives.Yes and becoming slaves of technology , our own creation is right as because the generation is exposed infront ofthese technologies which are affecting there brain and mind and creating urge regarding computers mobiles and pc games . But that certainly doent means slave.on the quest of having a good life we need all these technologies to run our life smoothly as today we get everything on internet which once a time was not possible but now with its presence we can get anything from any corner of world."
188,3,3_266,"My answer would be a very big YES for this question,everyone loves whatever a new technology whether it may be a mobile phone,a laptop or any other device or gadget,because whatever new arrives is always better than the previous version of it.Hence people fall in love of the new technology.Today mobile phone has became the 4th very important need after the three basic needs i.e food,clothing and shelter.A mobile phone allows you a very convenient way of communication.We cannot visit each and every person to say hi,hello or any other important topic to be discussed.Technology is everywhere,not only in mobiles but also in medical as well as military,army,navy and airforce.Technology is a must in day to day life,but there are some advantages and disadvantages of technology,so let's discuss it further...coming to the advantages mobile,google,whatsapp,facebook,youtube,twitter etc. are all made for the imporatant aspect of learning every thing new each and every day by machines or humans.today machines such as computers can teach you almost anything from basic do it yourself at home to building a bike for yourself or creating an program or app for self help and help others only if you have a internet connection in your pc.other social netwotking sites can be used for communicating anyone from any corner of the world without physically being present at the place or in front o the person you want to communicate with for discussing any important topic you need.Technology has some drawbacks too! many people are using facebook,whatsapp and other such websites and applications just to waste their self and others time by posting shitty jokes and posts every now and then.no one is benefiting from it instead they are finding a way to get entertained theirself and entertain others.some people are trying and posting illegeal hacks for soda machines or petrol pump machines which is almost impossible where there is a person to filling the fuel(petrol pump attendant).not just this but stealing your personal data from some famous social networking websites like facebook etc. a hacker can use your personal information to steal your hard earned money from your bank without knowing you personally by just using some odd techniques like software or programming.Finally i want to say that Technology can neither be good nor be bad it depends from person to person whether to use it for a good purpose or bad.thank you."
189,3,3_45,"Yes, i am agree given above statement. because impact of technology is also affected human behaviour. technology addiction with more and more developments being made with technology ,it is becoming more and more common for people all around the world to become addicted to it.

Altough technology may be useful in many ways, it can also be extermely dangerous and harmful to those who abuse and become addicted to it.internet is of the form of technology, which is pehhaps the most universal form of technology. internet is free for the users. people everywhere use it. there are infinite things to do while on the internet. this includes browsing and doing research, looking up the latest news or gossip, watching tv and movies ,playing online games, social networking, and many other things. it is therefore, no wonder that the internet is so addictive. however, with this addiction comes several dangers.As you can tell technology and its many forms, wheather this is through the internet, through video games,through mobile devices, or through television can be highly addictive, and with these addictions come dangers. they can cause issues one's social life, family life, school life, and work life. not only this but becoming addicted to technology can affect one's health. technology so as not to become addicted to it."

Although technology may be useful in many ways,it canalos be extremely dangerous and harmful to thosewho abuse and become addicted to it.To some extent I agree with a statement that we have become a slaves of technology,ourown creation because of following reasons:1. INTERNET, one form of technology, is perhaps the most universal form of technology. people everywhere have access to it,and for the most part is is free to ggo onto.This include browsing and doing research ,looking up lates knowledge,etc...along with this spending an extensive time on the Internet can also damage one's health ,both mentally and physically.the INTERNET can be sueful but ab extremely hazardous when abused.2. Just like INTERNET addiction, VEDIO GAME addiction is very danger face as well.people who do not monitor their gaming activity or practice it in morderation can run into many problems associated with vedio game addiction. the amount of time spent on games is fairly common problem.many games require the investment of a lot of time to complete,many taking over30 or 40 hours. People may forgo other responsibilities like spending time with family, focusing on academics,etc..3. One of the common advancement of technology is i.e.,cellphones. people are using widely as the need and today's generating and youth are not only using for commercial and personal puporse but they are also for wrong puposes.Conquering on addiction oftechnology,the first television was released in 1994, and as the time goes on television introduced in the market with new add on featuresSo as the the time goes on technologies are comoing uptodate as itz a human being creationof mind and most of the people are geting addicted to it."
191,3,3_137,"Technology was been invented for the betterment of the lifestyle of people, also to reduce human efforts in doing any exhausting work. In olden era humans used to do all the heavy stuff by themselves. Then they starting inventing tools to reduce their work load. They invented cutting tools like knife and hammers etc. The invention of wheels was a trademark in the feild of technology. Then from then technology is been improving day by day. The extent of advancement in technology can be seen as there is no human requrirement in working facilities because the humans are being replaced by the automated machines. Technology has become a necessisity evil. As we are so much into technical gadgets that in their absence life could become a chaos. Yes, technology has become a new addiction because even very minute work is been done by machines not by ourselves. We have adapted ourselves in such a manner that human effort is getting reduced drastically. Like for example using a vaccum cleaner for cleaning the house instead of doing by on our own. So clearly we can see that we have become slaves of our own creation. Technology was not beingdeveloped tominimize our work load to zero, instead it was developed to reduce our load. Doing physical work not only reduces our habit of depending on appliances but it also affects our health. As by doing work we are actually doing physical exercise which can reduce obesity, boredom, heart related diseases etc. So if we use less of technology it would be beneficial for our healths only. So it can be concluded that excess of everything is bad. However good it is if done excessively it damages everything."
192,3,3_9,"yes,technology has become an addition to most of ,except for the older generation ,i suppose.people are requisitely involved in the technology in some or the other ways.Every min of a person can be known to the other people around, anytime &amp; anywhere in the world . Technology dors simplifies our work &amp; does help in finishing our work in lesser time but with the severe use of it ,leads the person to become handicapped to an extend.Increasing demands of technology in life somewhere weaken 's the ability to run our own minds without any dependence on technlogy.Like prior everyone did their mathmetical calculation by themself ,without the requirement of calculators,computers,mobile &amp; so on.The better the technology gets lazier the people become.Technologies can be so addictive sometimes that it make our vision weak ,due which consuming of specticals are higher than earlier. It is becomes essential for us to remember ,that technology is formulated by us ,therefore using it in a minimal amount or the required amount is in our choice.Creatations are done with a mindset of easing life of human-race not for their ruining their life by making us lazy,prone to diseases,incompetend for our coming life."
193,3,3_243,"Nowadays Technology has become a new addition .Comparing to oldendays, the tecnology has advanced in all the direction.Now a days the life is made eaiser because of developing tecnology.        One or one way ,we are addicted to the technology. The work which can be made by 10 people in 10 days ,the same work is done in one day with the help of technology. In all the sectors the technology is playing an important role. All the sectors are addicted to the technology.Because ,the technology makes the work eaiser , more effective and with higher efficiency and speed the work can done.The growth of any nation , organization , company depends on how much advanced tecnology they are using. New ideas can be implemented in better way with help os       On the other hand the technology as its own demerits also. SWome of the people are using the technology in wrong way. The advanced technology is miss used for making explosives , weapons , nuclear explosives . These are dangerous to man kind. the tecnology is miss uesd by the students, childrens and other who does no use the technology in a correct manner. this is wasting the time, changing the minds of young chind in wrong way. the 10 people work can be done by one machine (technology) , the 10 people will loose there jobs ,this increases the unemployment , which in turns leads to poverty.      The conclusion is  we have becomes slaves of technology . Technology has become a new addiction. It has its own merits and demerits. We can neither say tecnology is good nor bad. It all depends in which way we make use of the technology . As far as possible we have better use of technology."

We have created lot of improved technogoy thinking that we would rule on it but the situation now is reversed,becouse without the the help the technogoy we can not do a simple things for example in classes earlier days calculations are done by the hand it self which increases the thinking capacity of a parson but using calculator we are not giving any stress to mind which maid the talent of boy or girl useless.Above example is a very simple example to illustrate the present situation if we takes higher case mobile is also have advantage and disadvantage.Simple examole for it is,net connection which makes life simpler and better but it harms the life of people. Radiations which are coming out from the harm us and couses deasises. This is not end of the problem as again and again we fall in technology. According to me new technology is important for life and to develop the nation although we have addicted to it we need to go with it only as the technology increases life style of normal people too and it makes proud in all kind of things. We also notice that many people using the technology in bad manner so we need to avoide those things and develop still more technology and we have to intruduce these to common people also and should be the part of developing nation and think twice that technogoy is using for good thingf only. Technology is not like as that as we discussed it is developed by us but it take control on us and vic versa"

Those people also has less diseases and any problem in life .But now a days the people becomes lazy day by day and want to work by sitting at one place.Today people are suffering from many disease and doesn't have any intreast in working during there jods due to machines.I agree that people become the slaves of technology as the want to do more use of machines during working for simple task also nowdays people had great inventions in different types of machines and also looking for further technology.I think one should use technology as it made for our but within the limit using more of anything can make us addict of itwe should also look for health.people todays becoming weaker and less strengthful day by day causes many diseases like diabetics, high blood pressure, sometimes it cause high attack due to uv rays which affect us during use of pc in company .We should minimize the use of technology and use it and possible to reduce the use as much as possible .But sometimes it can be understand that there is need of technology we should it .as our scientist are inventing new technology the are working means the are doing there work.So we should think how much to use and where to useOne should be aware of what it is doing and it ill effect.We should moreever do our work without technology were our normal strength and memory is required. and for remaining we should use technology E.g.Instead of saving phone no. in mobile we should learn them wehich will also improving our grasping power and memory.

199,3,3_52,"Yes technology really becomes a new addiction to both the generations modern as well as old, which is very harmfull to every one. As we can see that in this era we become slave of technology, our own creation, which is very bad thing. This time we are not realizing this, but in the coming time we definitly have to suffer from this problem because with the help of these technologies although our work become easy but at the same time we are destroying our body.As in the modern era there are so many technologies by which we have to deal daily and it is also true that somewhere these technologies are very important but not for all the human being. Some human beings which are physically fit and fine need not to use these technologies. These technologies were made for those who have some problems in doing their work like physically handicapped but in this era it is opposite. People who are physically fit and fine were using these technology and the people who were not physically fit and fine are not able to use these technologies because they do not know how to use these modern technologies which is very bad.So we have to arrange the something for those who really have to use these technologies so that they can work easily and need not to face any dificulty in there work. We also have to arrange programs for those who need not want to use this but are using not to use these technologies because somewhere these tchnologies were harmfull to our health and wealth.At the end i want to some say that although somewhere these technologies were making our body destroy but at the same time i want to say that these technologies were very important for making our future bright. So we have to use these technologies in a limited way so that no one can say that we are the slave of technology."
200,3,3_47,"Yes, I agree with the term that the technology has become a new addiction for our generation. Nowadays, Technology seems to be a biggest addiction in our town. Technology create an atmosphere in our minds, which helps to cut the time and to entertain us. But, we have become so much interested for technology. That, it becomes our necessities for day to day life. We can't imagine to survive without technology, Not even one day. Technology seems to be upgrading in the form of mobile phones and laptops as well as. It is being used in our day to day jobs , On the JOBS. We seems to be so habitual with technology, that we can't live without it. Technology upgradeation cut the jobs of many employees. The work is being done by the machines, which includes the upgaded technology inbuilt in them.There are various points which shows the importance of technology which helps to become a new addiction for us. Which are as follows :-1. We can't imagine to communicate with one another without technolgy, which have been included in mobile phones.2. We travels with our transports vehicles, which is embedded with technology.3. In our on the job process, technology is being used by us in the form of laptops.Technology is not being used by adults only but also being used by kids as well. Nowadays, Schools also inculdes technology in the form of smart class, smart education and projectors to teach students. Technolgy make all the things automatic. That's why peoples are not preferring to do the job manually. Technology helps in marketing by makeing sale and purchase of goods and service with e-commerce. Technology is the thing which make us slaves and developing the innovations for all the human beings globally as well."
201,3,3_275,"It is true that we have become slaves of technology. Today&#039;s youth cannot go about their days without a cell phone in their hands. Video games are the new fad, with real life simulations and graphics. It creates a virtual world; an escape from the hardships of life. People get sucked into the black hole of technology, and are unable to leave once they are satisfied. They forget to stop and smell the flowers or take a walk in the park. But because technology is infinite, it can never satisfy us completely. It is truly our creation, and reflects man&#039;s need to achieve everything possible, at any cost. There may even be serious repercussions to overdeveloping technology. Cyber crime is one of them. This pyschological need of making technology less artificial is one of the main driving forces behind technology development. Another serious issue that such users face is that they use less of their own intelligence. The human brain needs to be tested time and again to exploit it&#039;s full potential; without it&#039;s usage, it no longer behaves as before.  Our brain is like an engine. If we don&#039;t provide fuel to it or don&#039;t run it often, it will rust away and become useless. This makes us all the more dependent on technology to make up for such losses, thus proving to be a vicious cycle. For example, we remember things by storing it in a particular part of our brain. Nowadays, people set Reminders on their cell phones. The same is the case with Alarm Clocks. Studies have actually proven that waking up to loud sounds can damage our brains overtime and mess up our body as well. Back in the day, the routine of people was such that they would wake at the same time every morning, without an alarm. They would wake up to the first rays of the sun shining through their windows.But, if we look at the bigger picture, technology has helped to bridge the gap between nations, social groups, religion, economic groups, etc. The biggest advantage is that we have become more aware of our surroundings. Technology has played a key role in communication between different cultures. It has helped us to address major world problems such as poverty, hunger, climate change etc and formulate potential solutions on a large scale. Social exchange has also been enhanced by technology. If used correctly, technology can help the world stay united. The misuse of it can lead to serious problems such as terrorism; which cannot survive without the use of technology. It is our duty to recognize the addiction being created, and to use technology to our advantage. It should not become our weakness."

In todays day, technology plays a vital role in mans life not only in development of the mans life but alsoplays huge role in day to day need of living being. We need technology in each and evey field which may start from giving birth to a baby to the death of a person. It has became a part of ones lifeIn factyou can take an example of me givingan test sitting far from the administration of amcat along with many other students using computer technology and the result of those could be accessed within instant using artificial intelligence in the computer system. This helps to give this exam throughout the country without getting into single place. Even documenting and analysing those would have been a hectic job without the use of technology.This is the best example of technology.But now the dependency of man on technology has became quiet a problem. We are so much dependent on technology that even sometimes we loses our own creativity. The hard working nature of human has been turned into laziness. Technology is created to ease mans life but we are more focused to replacing it with mans effort.In the current situation we are so much dependent on technology so much that our days startsby alarm clock and checking mobile phone to taking the mobile till sleep. People have more socialfriends than acutal physical ones. The use of mobile has been addictive to a great extent in human life. Clicking selfies and photos is more important to them than to enjoy actaul dentination and company.We should see to it that technology is created for the betterment of ones life and not for replacement of it."

Yes all this application are the best what they are using for.it's help us to commnicate with all the known and unkown person.but more importently its kill our time.when we are small we all go to play football and many more games but maximume of pepople are using all this app and not getting time to do all the other works.At last i am end my eassy by saying that technology become a new addit"

Technology has given new dimensions to our imaginations,ideas,views and help to do new innovations.Technology has increased the employability rate in our country.As most of the work in IT and other industries is done through computers, so more number of IT professionals are hired to do the work.So,it helps to increase the percapita income of our country.Through technology only,we can do our work in a smart way.So,technology has helped us to switch from doing hard work to smart work.By doing our work smartly, we can easily increase theproductivity level of various companies.Technology is not an addiction but its a way of doing our more efficiently and in an effective manner.India is still counted in the developing country, with the use of technology only,it can be counted in the list of developed countries.Technology-An art of making new innovations, doing creative things,optimizing the work and thus the key for the overall development of an individual .By this it is clear that the work of technology is to make the things more simpler in an economic manner which can be easily accessed by all people.Technology has power to overcome all the hurdles and to achieve to our targets.21st century is taken as the new step towards making our country digitalise and I m sure that in future also technology will lead to success of our country."

People now are soley depended on mobiles and different types of gadets, if I talk about the past, children would use libraries or use there own mind to complete a given task assigned to them, but today use of techo gadets have made there mind paralysed, they have lost there imaginative power to think on a particular thing.  Techology have made there mind shut and the fact is inspite of being a healthy tool for a country these gadets have resulted in making young minds lazy. It has always been noted and said by our forefathers that, how important is it to play and involve in outdoor activities,or how important is it to take ones own time out for self pleasure, but techology have given everything opposite to the said above statements. Techological oriented apps like facebook,whatsapp etc. have made the young generation far part from there loved one's. People have time to chat but not to meet, not even their parents. The pace by which the world is growing, in the same pace minds of people are stop working. Today everywhere or the other, we as an individual are surrounded with technology, making a recharge,depositing money,calling friend etc etc all these task have become so much easier and its just only because of technology, but then again with all these increasing leasure we are getting into a mechanical mode of era which would sooner or later result in huge loss for man power. When everything would be done electronically then where will man work? what task will he perform? Man would then be in hands of technology and the only fact left wiuld be hoe to survive.At the end i would only like to say that its good to eat but not to the extent that you cannot digest, in the same way its good to be techno friendly but not to be a slave in its hand."

These are the inventions which were done for making the human life easy. But people has become very much habitual to them. Even they do not give to much attention to their health. Students are getting distracted by these technologies. They enjoyed wasting there valuable time on computer and mobile scrence. They spend about 3/4 part of their whole day on internet and computers. They do not use the internet for their education and studies rathere they use the internet for chating on the social media and surffing on the internet. Nowadays internet is a very basic need of everyone. A person can live without home but he can not live without internet. So much use of computer scrence gave birth to various disease like eye problem and heart related problem. The radiation of Wifi is very harmfulfor the human beings. It is not so good for a person to spend so much time in front of the laptop and computer scrence. Some inventions like atom bomb and atomic weapons are invented to protect the people from the enimies but now they are being used for exploiting the people. These weapons are act as the reputation and status symbol of the country. Because of these technologies human being has become the enimy of itself.

The bond between peoples is weakening due to this. We are bocoming a slave of this technilogy, every morning the first thing people do is checking their phone then wishing good morning to a number of people who they never meet but do not wish the one that are near them.Every thing in this world is bad if used in excess and that goes with technology too.

Any kind of work these days involves the use of technology. From a little child who s addicted to his parents tablet and to a old person who uses it to read his daily newspaper. All kinds of people use technology in every possible way. These days even in schools instead of using blackboards their are using projectors displaying every lesson as a PPT presentation. There is no effort of teachers. The communication between the students and the teachers have become less due to technology. There are few examples where we have  become slaves to technology. Nowadays all products are machine made using the technology. So there is no use of man power this is causing unemployment. From farming to manufacturing of big machinery, all are using technology which decreases the chance of employment. My suggestion is, yes it is difficult in moving big and heavy loads but only a man can handle and guide these things which can improve employment. Technology used in a limited way can help human existence evolve more in a positive way. We are the ones who developed technology for  making our work easier and to make efficient use of time. Some threatening issues have occurred these days due to misuse of technology. Nuclear power plants and applications of human robots in different ways have caused nations to ban and texting them. Use of human robots in daily life for smaller work have made humans more lazy. Testing of power plants have threatened wildlife and caused environment pollution. We have to stop misusing technology"

In Western Countries, technology is much more used than remaing most of world. It provides a direction for progressive development of a nation, rapid development but not necessarily sustainable development, but the talk here is on micro level, not macro. The same goes for micro level, as the persons from those developed countries are most dependent on technology than those of developing. In today context, every second person on an average is having a cell phone, a bank account and a profile on one or more social networking sites.

224,3,3_344,"I agree that the technology has become the addictionAccording to my view, technology has become the addiction. We use technology to get our work done in the spur of time. Technology has made things easier. Almost every age groupuse technology.Let us take an example of a college student. Every student usetechnology to get his/her work done. Suppose, that student need to submit theassignment then that student can mail the assignment to theteacher. By doing so, ease is there, no headache for teacher to carry those huge bundles of papers, no need to maintain those bundles.Let us take an example of a bussiness man. He need to attend a lot of calls during his work. Attending calls is what nothing else but technology. He may not even just attend call but also tranfer money online. this facilitates him by reducing effort and by saving his time which he can utilize in some other stuff. He also use the emailfacility for the work purpose.Now take my own example, now this AMCAT test facilitates students not to wander here and there in search of job. It takes our test online process it internally and give result in a fraction of time. It also helps companies by saving their time by finding the fine candidates which in turn reduces their effort and money. On the other hand, students get interview calls automaticaly.By doing so AMCATgets a lot of money.Now take another example, suppose you are travelling to some unknown place and you don't know their language. Now how will you come to know where to go? There is a technology named google maps, which will tell you where to go and also about some awesome places of that particular region. It just not only tells about the direction but also how far it is from your current location. This surely helps you to enjoy your jouney.Now take another example of a common man.He can listen his desired music,videos and movies.There are lot of devices which is capable of doing so. Example of these devices are mobile phones, mp3 player, ipads, palm tops, laptops etc.So from the above liost of examples we can say that we are addicted to technology whether you are at home or somewhere else.Weuse itin every field."

Nuclear Weapons, as we know them are the dangerous of them all but with continious developmet it seems that we are not afraid of the outcomes of a Nuclear war that could happen at any point of time because of terrorism or unacceptable monarchs,Which themselves are incapable of connecting to the real world. The nuclear tests which are being conducted to verify the devastation they can cause are themselves are causing destruction to the environment in forms of polluting soil,air or water and looking deep into this we can easily estimate what implementation of these weponariers can cause.The race of producing arms and weapons will procede to its limits as the hatread among the countries, hatred among the men of Jeasus increses but that could be put to an end using various country bound trities, making hard decisions but that way more cheaper than wiping out the entire human existernce.The growth which motivates us to do better mustn't elevate us to do somethiong that is not in public interest and something like nuclear weapon or nuclear war which is a threat nowadays is the upper limit. Getting better is the next step everyone take to make themselves capable of doing something new, something wonderful but preparing to tackle the hate is much corresponding to hate so, making tough decisions as said already is more acceptable and generous for the entire human race rather developing or respiondinmg to the nuclear war whichj could ultimately lead to Nuclear Winter. It is not suggested that the technoliogy should be restricted to grow but not the cost of environment and not certainly on the cost of mankind."

For example , The peoples of Bhopal are victims of Nuclear attack. The newborn childs are handicapted , mentally not matured and number of aborsions are increased very large measure.Atomic attack can destroy the entire country.For a healthy country we must reduce the production of weapons and arms. Now a days the number of nuclear power stations are increased greatly. The chemicals relesed from the nuclear power stations cause many problems to the generatons.And nuclear attacks are increased now a days.Nuclear attack cause many harmful problems to the living organism.In Jeppan almost all nuclear stations are stoped becouse it causes many problems to the normal life of people in that country.In India we are creating new nuclear power station for energy , but in is a thred to the people. In the comming Decades the war between two countries is may be with Nuclear wepons.And the result of ar must take all living organisms from the Earth. this means the production of nuclear wepons is a thrad to the living organisms. All the representatives of the country must be aware of this problem and must reduce the production of nuclear weponse.It can create a peaceful tommoroSuper Powers on the Earth want to conquer the entire world.this has triggered a nuclear race in the world.

Actually nuclear weapons are developed very fastly, as compared to the weapons. It is really a challenging position for the human beings. Superpowers on Earth want to conquer the entire world. This has triggered a nuclear race in the world. We have to concider that, every coin has both pros and cons.We have to concentrate on advantages of producing arms and weapons in this nuclear era. Man can do any thing by using his mind. He can built any weapons and arms by using his brain. So nuclear weapons also made by the human only. So he can also made so many weapons to overcome this problem. As technology increases day by day. Every country tries to become a super power country in the world. For this reason they create different types of nuclear bombs. To face these situations we have to make new type of weapons.A.P.J.Abdul Kalam, our indian scientist invented the nuclear projects secretly. It is one example that our Indians also developed in making weapons. But, inventing one method is not enough. The government should provide some facilities to our scientists who are really making new inventions for making weapons and arms.The disadvantage of making these explosives may give us problems. We know that Hiroshima naga sakir, still the people at that place are being suffered with many diseases. By considering these also we have to make the weapons and arms. We are considering these issues but, our enemy countries are not bothered about the people. Their aim is to defeat our country and be a super power country in the world. For this reason they make very dangerous bombs. So, we have to face them and won in that war. For this reason the race in the production of arms and weapons in the era of nuclear development is really a challenging for human beings.Many people have talent in making new weapons. But, our government was not supporting them. If our government supports the talented people, they may create wonders in making weapons and arms. This is the challenging situations to our government why because the higher authorities never give chance to the new people. Thats why our country is still developing country not a developed country. As compared to the pros and cons it is very important to produce arms and weapons in this challenging position."

As everyone wants its safety first as its said that when you are alive you the asset for your family and belongings. Self safety is the basic motive of one&s living so this race has lead to many intra-country wars likerecently Indo-Pak war which is being held now a days. As we all know Russia is the largest weapon producing country and mostly every country purchases the weapons from them only.The effect of this race in our life is that it may cost a huge amount of money which may effect the economic state of the country. This may also lead to the destruction of environment and all the nature&s creation i.e. animals. This may also cause the life disasters as it may rise a war among them and many human life is in danger with effect from this.As every country have made its soldiers trained and they are giving there whole life to the country and because of them we are able to live happily and freely. the political pressure is the main victim for this as evry political leadfers want the power in their hands and rule the world according to their wish.Beside of so much worse effect of it there are some points favourable to the situation that is this race is important as we all know the condition of the world therec is so much of competition and wars among the human of different races they all dislike each other due to past experience or some of the personal issue between them so this is weapon are used for the self defence of one&s own life.

235,5,5_11,"Era of Nuclear Development The production of arms and weapons in the era of nuclear development is expanding its wing and are affecting the existence of human beings. If it is properly used, then it can lead the mankind. But if it misused then the whole mankind will be destroyed and ruined.The reason behind this beginning of nuclear race is the emergence of superpowers on that want to conquer the entire world. Example the bomb dropped by America in Japanese place i.e. Hiroshima and Nagasaki during second world war is still having a huge impact. The fight between two nations made every human being of these attacked places to suffer. So nuclear development should take place for the growth and progress of the nation and for the benefit of the mankind and not for the benefit of ownself."

The experiments in the field of nuclear development is a great threat to the human race itself.Thus the superpowers on Earth is trying to conquer the entire world.In future if a war occurs they want to be the most powerful and wants to defeat the entire world.But they forget that , the use of nuclear weapons can badly affect the human race.According to my point of view, superpowers has triggered a nuclear race in the world. As the examples suggest that, the nuclear war happened in Hiroshima and Nagasakki is still troubling the human race.The after effects of the war were very dreadful.And if such a war occur in future, it could destroy the whole wide world.So, I completely disagree with the making and experimenting of dangerous weapons."
237,5,5_264,"Human civilization has come a long way from collecting food and resources, looking for shelter and surviving in caves. Today, in this world the needs have changed. People have endless money and desires, and yet they lust for more never tends to cease. The world we live in now has a different culture as it was centuries ago. We have countries divided by political boundaries and the interests and requirements differ accordingly. Apart from all these, the main objective nowadays has been the urge to delclare themselves as superior powers in the world. In this desire, man has built guns, tanks, fighter jets, nuclear bombs and what not.We all know about Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour during world war 2. The Japanesehad destroyed their air base and almost all aircrafts in Pearl Harbour. America replied to this attack by the infamous nuclear bombing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where the children still are born disabled for the radiation that still persists in the air.It does makesme and every other Indian proud that our country is a nuclear superpower. We are not much behind from the biggest superpower in the world in any aspect. Indians are equally successful as any other country. Recently, Pakistan has also been able to develop nuclear weapons in recent times. Keeping in mind the present situation and Pakistan's countless effort to shake us down, it can be said that a nuclear war maybe on it's way.In my opinion, wars have never helped in raising the economy or literacy level in a country. Nor has it been able to tacklepoverty. So, I think that the need of the hour is to concentrate more on human resource development and not on ways to build weapons that tend todemolish and destroy an entire nation as a whole. There must be more competition for people to compete in the international market and establish themselves to lead a happy and succesful life."

The events following the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki still remains a fresh horror in our minds. Mankind has evolved a lot in the recent century. Thanks to the progress in science and technology, our living conditions have improved. Death rates have come down, life expectancy has increased. However, we are in verge of a serious threat, the nightmare of a 'Nuclear war'.In the ancient times, humans waged wars to increase their territories, then duringmedival times, wars based on religious grounds were fought, for example the crusades in Europe. In the recent times however, the reasons have become too much complicated besides the fact that superpowers want to conquer the entire earth. Business andeconomics play an important role, resulting in the conflict between nations. A new obstacle towards world peaceis terrorism. In the wake of the 21st century, we have lost many innocent blood due to this. So, in order to curb every anti-national activities and secure the lives of its citizens, developmentin military forces is the need of the hour.Many developed as well as developing nations have started manufacturing or buying military equipments. In India, the expenditure allotted to research has been increased a lot. This has rewarded us with the indigenous BrahMos missile. Nuclear warheads are also kept as security measures. It may not be that everytime a conflict arises, it will be elevated to full-scale nuclear war. Frankly, no nation wants that. Almost every nation equipped with nuclear warheads maintains a 'no-first strike' policy.This race in the production of arms and weapons is endless. Everyone likes to be on top and possess the most newest and upgraded technologies. Yes, for ensuringsecurity this paranoia is justified, but it must also me kept in mind that we really do have enough weapons to destroy our planet as we know a couple of times. I think its high time we stop this hypocracy and make peace among ourselves. After all, war is never a solution. It leaves back a scar which further triggers more complexities."

The race for building advanced WMD continues not knowing that if that kind of money was invested in development of the country ,The world would have been a better place. The countries never share the technologies or equipment with each other regarding nuclear weaponary as this may lead to contingency towards each other. United Nations or the UN plays a major role of politics , The countries having the veto power dosen't let the rivals to enjoy profits regarding nuclear weaponary or nuclear matters.This race of nuclear weaponary is endless as one will always try to make itself better than the other .Year after year ,There is always an introduction of new technology regarding nuclear weaponary ,The elite faces or the developed countries always try to be aware of the new thing in town or to make sure no one gets thier hands on the things which they know.This abstraction is not the only thing which is adopted by an individual ,It is world wide as every country in this world hides something from one another and that something being nuclear weaponary.An example can be taken as when India wanted to join the nuclear suppliers group but was thrashed by the rivals who wanted India to share their nuclear interests with them ,India in turn refused to share the information and still remains a victim of veto power in the United Nations .The countries playing as support to India ,majorly russia ,holds the veto power but cannot prevail over the rivals who holds the same power."

These powers could help our country which is not afraid of others nuclear arms as their could be sudden response to any the demonetizing act of the other country. But civilions of some of the countries are afraid of the powers their country have. Therefore every super power have some kind of pros and cons.

From ancient regional tribes to medeival warlords to today&s superpowers, we have been witnessing this lust for dominance. More often than not, this lust has created demons which mankind has failed to contain. The ongoing arms race is one such demon. With the advent of nuclear technology, this demon has developed more dangerous fangs. Some of the biggest countries today are spending billions of dollars in nuclear weapon research, a significant part of humanity is still truggling with basic issues like healthcare, education and sanitation. This money could have found a much better use had it been put towards researching cure for cancer, subsidising treatment for AIDS, building schools, providing low cost housing etc. Additionally, as with any arms race, we are building weapons more dangerous than any that we have ever seen. A new bomb with the capability of wiping out an entire city from a thousand miles away is being hailed as an achievement! These weapons in the hands of any army, leave alone terrorists is extremely dangerous. It is only a matter of time before more people like Kim Jong, the unpredicatble North Korean dictator get their hands on destructive nuclear weapons. As long as these weapons are secure in the hands of strongest militaries, with responsible world leaders, there is one benefit that they have helped achieve - risk of nuclear warfare ensures that many battles are averted. Nuclear powers India and Pakistan refrain from large scale waIn their wake, the nuclear weapons have given rise to some advantages - nuclear power being the most relevant one. This is one of the cleanest source of energy available to us today. Some Western European countries are really taking advantage of this energy."

There is a competition among the counries of the world to emerge as the superpower and conquer the whole world. This leads to salient effects on the global sphere. To flaunt their strengths, countries are producing more and more arms and weapons. The production of nuclear weapon is the recent move made by many countries of the world. The nuclear development is challenging the very existence of human beings. Although, it has lead to certain disadvantages but along with it, it has certain consequences.If we look into a broader perspective, we find that this race to evolve as a super power is compelling countries to be more powerful economically as well as socially. Developments are reachingheights. Increase in production enhances the manufacturind sector of he country, thereby providing jobs to young and skilled people. The countries become ready for any crisis. They are ready for any type of war and are capable to rely fiercefully. But as every coin has two faces, similarly there are certain disadvantages and consequences that follow.This race of being the superpower will lead the developed and powerful countries to dominate and supress the countries which are still in the phase of developing and are having weak economic and financial status. Moreover, the destructions which are caused by these weapons degrade the economic status of the country. The human beings are the one who suffer the most. They lose their family and friends. These activities bring shortage of food and water. The countries, on the road to conquer the world are forgetting about the most important factor, that is the life on earth. They are risking the existence of human race to conquer the world.Production of arms and nuclear weapons are good for a country to have pride, but it should be kept in mind that when this thing turns into a nuclear race to conquer the world it only brings destruction and misery tothe people of their own nation."

For the nation it is very neccessary to to make weapons for making our country powerfull from others, but we should remember that we should not misuse of it.There are so many things which are very important to remember that we try to ignore these weapons untill we do not required to use this. Sometimes people use weapons to harm other people without any hesitation, but it is totally wrong thing. To make our country very powerfull we can make weapons and we can alos help other countries to save them from terorism. If we are using weapons in proper manner then we can increase our power and our country will be economically get strong. On the other hand the wrong use pf the weapons it can destroy us. Weapons are very important in the era of nuclear development. the race of making weapons is also useful, whenever we do not have sufficient weapons then we can not fight from the terorism and other country. For any country weapons are very important part because it makes us very powerful as well as safe. So in the era of nuclear development it is very neccessary to make weapons. We should remeber some points which are very important for us like we should use weapons in a proper manner, untill we do not need to use it we should not use it. We should try to handle the thing from the talk, and when we feel it is not working then we try to make sure that is there any other opotion or not, at last we use the weapons. Because weapons can destroy the world in just few minoutes, so we should try to ignore of using weapons. We should try make a peacefull country and people of that country are very understandable and mature as well. Now the time is changed, people know what is good or bad for them. So we can say that we should make weapons for making our country powerful and helpful for others. By transporting the weapons we can increase our economical strenght, and our country will get developed. Weapons are the be all and end all of any country, because it make us safe as well as powerful from others. For the nuclear development weapons are very impor"

Its a alarming signal to the world, that many reports by different different policy makers and researchers depict that many country's in the world are planning to develop their nuclear power capacity. As a result of this alarm India too had tried to keep its pace of change and recently signed a deal relating to nuclear power and trade of nuclear technology and equipments with Japan. Moreover, our Defence Minister Mr. Manohar Parrikar made a statement stating that the time may have come for the nation to revise its nuclear policy of defending any nuclear attack and not to be the first in place to use nuclear weapons.The increasing production of nuclear weapons and the race between nations to produce more nuclear weapons can be very harmful to the existence of mankind. Right from the starting the production to using it all may proove to be very harmful. Producing nuclear weapons in an area can pollute it at really bad levels, It may lead to many health hazards to the workers working at the place. Any mismanagement in factory or the place of storage can lead to another man made disaster. Using nuclear weapons in war can make vast land area of affected nation barren and will lead to mass destruction of mankind and humanity. Moreover addressing the core issues like poverty are more necessary for nations rather than spending heavily on nuclear weapons."

These two nuclear bombs shook this prestine mother land and killed millions instantly and continues to do so even now. Nuclear Race- A race to develop and foster advancement in nuclear technology has infested this world like a rogue disease. Missile Technology control Regime(MTCR), Nuclear Suppliers Group(NSG) and many other organizations have been set up, trying to keep a check on this menace. But all this is going in vain, North Korea unaltered by the restrictions by UN is continuously testing and developing new nuclear weapons, Superpowers going for even more deadly weapons .But it's time to stand still for a minute and look back at what we really have got after such aggression ?After all these years, thousands of lives have been tormented by this ugly truth . Thousands of lives still live in fear of being destroyed.The story of fukushima power reactor, nuclear tests contaminating the land and lives of people of Uzbekistan , the disaster of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the millions of lives living under the agony of losing their loved ones in these incidents can't be easily forgotten . Neither can their pain be pacified. The only console they can possibly feel is by getting a chance to see this world completely free of these nuclear weapons and their menace. This can be their only desire and hope that their oncoming future generation won't see this disaster ever again.Superpowers like USA , China , Russia have been increasingly involved in this race of getting ahead of the each other but while pursuing this race they have for sure forgotten the fact that ""there is no limit to power"" and ""thirst to power can never be quenched"" . And so their yearning for getting of each other is taking them to nowhere but destruction, not only for them but for the countless of other innocent lives that are going to be part of this deadly and insane race.As the legendry actor, comedian Charlie Chaplin has said -""We don't need power to do anything good. we only need love for that. Power is needed only when we have something bad to do""."

They are still keep saying that they are in the way of peace and try to make this world a better place for humans and also for other creatures, animals and every lifes. But everyone have a scare on others, they also try to keep protects their families, relatives. people loves other peoples and also afraid of them, beacuse not everyones intention to make a better place, so to protect the females, families from bad peoples every country have there own nuclear weapon and research center for a backup. They dont wanna tryit, but if such situationcomes they will do whatever they dont wanna do. Its a good thing that every country have there own weapon and security but it also bad as well.

The race in the production of arms and weapons in the era of nuclear development is challenging the very existence of human beings. Has anyone thought about ,'how useful is this race for the whole mankind ?'. Let us discuss the pros and cons on the same topic.The super powers on the Earth invite various war conditions. A war is said to be a nuisanse without a nuclear attack. Launching a nuclear bomb to any area ,ends up the life in that area for years. The infants taking birth in the nearby areas also face the worse effects. The draw backs of the nuclear bombing in the regions, Hiroshima and Nagasaki of Japan , can still be seen after so many years. The new borns there, are seen to have some or the other deficiency. Some wars are essential, but not all.Wars not only affect mankind but wildlife too. As a consequence of nuclear attacks, many species appear to get extinct. Natural sources to support the life on the Earth also get damaged in nuclear bombing. When we encapsulate all these consequences, we see that there isno good result. Hence, it is very right to say that, 'The race in the production of arms and weapons in the era of nuclear development is challenging the very existence of human beings'.We as the civilians of any area, state or country , dream of leading a happy peacefullife. We talk of bringing peace and harmony in our individual countries. Why don't we talk of bringing peace and harmony on the Earth? Is it so difficult to understand? At the end of the day we all are humans. Then why do we fight? The best way to reduce natural calamitieslies in respecting the nature and prevailing the feeling of brotherhood with humanity."

Here the superpowers on Earth are using these nuclear weapons for destroying each other.By destroying each other,they are destroying the world.And as said before the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki is the first thing that comes to mind on hearing the word 'nuclear' and it is a proof that there are more cons than pros. I can't explain any importance for the development of nuclear arms and weapons.Why we need such dreadliaest weapons when we can live in peace?The loss it creates can never be compensated.Thousands of people lost their lives due to such nuclear race between the countries and the same number are still suffering.

256,5,5_377,"In the era of nuclear development, the race in production of arms and weapons is challenging for human beings. Nuclear powers on earth wanted to conquer the entire world. So, the nuclearrace which has been triggered in the word is little concern to the human beings. Superpowers on earth is increasing in one or other ways by making nuclear missiles and other things and they also wanted to conquer the entire world where the production of arms and weapons in the era of nuclear deveopment is lagging behind.Nuclear energy is considered an energy which can never be diminished. Due the the lack of renewable resources nuclear energy is being used a lot and it is also causing great harm to human beings. Even if we talk about the war which is going on between India and Pakistan which is continuosly increasing so if any of these countrieswill use the nuclear missiles, this mayaffect the neighbouring countries around these two countries, even it can also affect our future generations also. Souse of nuclear powers as compared to arms and weapons can be very harmful for human beings. As using arms and weapons will not affect the whole world and our future generations.If someone has superpowers, then that person will try to conquer the entire world maybe he can use it for good or bad its upto that person. But superpowers on earth will change the living of the entire world if it is being used for wrong then it will become too hard to stop. In the era of nuclear development it will become too difficult for the people with arms to stop this superpowers on earth. Even if we use great amount of arms we can only stop this superpower on earth by using superpower only. Because superpowers like nucclear weapons cannot be stopped or limited by common personnel which uses arms or weapons.In my opinion, there are lots of pros and cons for human beings in this endless race because using superpowers will affect a lot to the entire worldand if it is being used for wrong then it will become too difficult to stop. But if it is being used for good then it will be very benificial for the entire world."

The production of nuclear weapons is increasing now a days. This is somewhat useful and protect our country and helping a country to feel more secured. It is also help in country's development. But a country spends lots of money in making these nuclear weapons, which we use in other field or in making a bright future of children by educating them due to which childrens learn moral values and ethics which leads to the reduce in war and terrorism. Most of the terrorism or fights increasesdue to the illiteracy, people do not have any idea about religions and they do not able to think properly and thus not be able to put their own views and thoughts and thus the terrorism increases which leads to increase in death rates.The advantage of increase in the production of arms and weapons is that if any terrorist attack happen at any time then our country will ready to use these nuclear weapons to protect our human beings. This also helps our country to feel more secured. But also there is a policy in India that India will never attack first on any other country with nuclear bomb. Thus any other country may take it as a advantage and attack on India. Moreover India has less number of nuclear bomb as compared to other countries like USA.Thus in last, I want to say that every coin has two faces, similarly the production of nuclear arms and weapons has its positive as well as negative aspects. The positive side is that it helps a country to feel more secured and protect the human beings. The negative side is that a country spends lots of money in making thse weapons and arms, instead of investing these money for country's growth and development by increasing the literacy rate."

There are so many helpby thenucler power first, many of the countries use it for the production of electricity in their country. And many others use it for making wepons to protect their country from enimies. As we knowthere are many rules for the use of the nucler energy but none of them were followed.

In this the england is not defeted and became stronger .Later after many years some europian countries became strong and one of the main important country is germany. Because of hitler in germany the army became strong and later it involved in world war 2.Many countries added up againest germany and attacked it with a nucler bomb on the cities called hiroshima and nagasaki. After the attackthe cities collapsed in disaster.even after 65 years of attack still now the nuclear bomb effecting in various ways.The world got shock after this affect and UNO always supports peace.Now the nuclear technology is avalable for every country and in any case there is an worldwar 3 then the people on earth is an imagination. So experts suggest that not to use nuclear weapons to destroy any country.In my opinion the use and development of nuclear weapons is right but only to a limit. We have to use them only at conditions that there is no alternative to a problem rather than using it.But using it to become the superpower on earth is the worst idea.Earth and people on it are suffering with more problems so rather than concentrating on the things like to become super power it is better to think and develop the individual growth and solve every problem in the manner of peace.WAR IS NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION AVAILABLE FOR THE PROBLEMS THERE ARE MANY ALTERNATIVES.THE BEST IS PEACE.

Every country wants to reach top of the world in each and every fight either the fight of money, groth and devlopment. Every country have their own army forces, their own weapons.We all know about the coundtion of India and Pakistan relation. In now time every day these two country makes the war situation. It is very harmful for all the people who live in india and Pakistan. These two country has their powerful army forces. These two country have many weapons. And most important both of them have nuclear power. So for all these thing its easyly comes that these two country are have sufficiant power to distroy the world largrst population. In todays time some countyrs are give their support of terroism. So it is also very impotant to fight with these type of countries. Now days we all listine about the stricks of terririst in LOC. They are killing many inocent people, distroing many places. So it most importent to fight with these type countries. India have sufficient arms and weapones to fight with terriosm. India always readt to give the proper reply to the terririst. So it is very importent for tany country that they have lot of weapons and arms forces.

These arms and weapons have become very important for every countory for there level of safety. Due to these things there is a lot of issues arising in environment like testing of these weapons may lead to damage in the environment. There also a lose of cultural and historical values of ones self. Today also we remember the nuclear bomb attack on Hiroshima and nagasaki , where there was a huge lose of many life and the wealth.

This has lead to a big race between them and has created a unstable situation for the very existing human kind and this world. Every country wants to be at the top in evrey field of development.So talking about the nuclear development in this world, the competition is at its peak. This race in the production of nuclear weapons has distorted not only the lives of the people but also affected the places, animals and various parts of the earth. Superpowers like United States, Russia and China always show their powers in nuclear fields as they are the developed parts of this earth. Some of thecountries like Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan etc are misusing these nuclear weapons and arms and promoting terrorism in the world. So terrorism is the biggest challenge for the human race and the world. Terrorism is onlygrowing because of fact that these inhumane people have an access to these nuclear instruments. They has not only triggered wars in the past but has also created fear in th normal lives of the people.It is obviously true that, the race in the production of arms and weapons in the era of nuclear development is challenging the very exisitence of human beings. This race is not benefitial for the humans, as there is no need to kill each others for no reason. The nuclear bomb attack of 9/11 in Penatagon, Washington was the cheapest act done by the terrorist and from that time onwards, terrorism is growing continuosl. Another example of the nuclear attack was happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and nobody can forget the 26/11 attack in Mumbai. So we need to stop this poor act of terrorism and stop this nuclear race amongst each other."

The invention of nuclear bombs can bevery harmful as well as beneficial to the whole mankind. It is harmful as it can extinct the entire population of a country, i.e., the existence of human beings can vanishes. But on the other hand, I have mentioned here that it has benefits as well. Nuclear weapons represent the power of a country. The countries having nuclear arms and weapons are now considered as the most powerfull countries of the world. It is also necessaryto produce these types of weapons in order to protect the country against superpowers or we can say them terrirists. They continuously make attempts to conquer the entire world.

286,5,5_285,"Era Of Nuclear Development In this modern world, the use of arms and weapons have been increased tremendously. There are good uses and bad uses of arms and weapons. Humans have created arms and weapons for the welfare of themankind. These are meant for the protection of human beings. But in these days, the usage of these things have become a threat to mankind. Now-a-days in mediawe can hear about the terrosist activities that took place around the globe. They are using well sophisticated weapons to destroy mankind. Nuclear bombs, missiles have also become a threat.For example, we know the nuclear activity took place in Bhopal,Hiroshima,Nagasaki. Thousands of humans lost their lifes due to the nuclear activities. People are facing the effects of such activities till now. Creators of arms and weapons didn't had any negative approches while creating these things. Today, terrosist activities have reached at their peak They are not even bothered about the lives of their brothers or sisters. We know that,all humans are related to each other. They live in brotherhood. Sharing love,care,sorrows between each other. But, Today these terrosists are not even thinking about precious lives of humans. Destroying everything have become a habit for them. The activities that occurred in the world especially Palasthine, France etc. made us feeling much concerned about their lives. In my opinion, the creation of arms and weapons have good usage as well as bad usage. And my opinion is stated above. Creation of these are meant for the welfare of humans. But, it has become a threat to whole mankind now. This is not a good thing. So, I conclude that the era of nuclear development have affected humans postively and negatively. These are meant for protection, not for destruction. Thank you!!"

For this there is a use of weapon. It is also useful for destroying waste materials. Weapons and arms are most useful for defeat the enemy. If a country have good technology based weapons and arms then that country can defeat their enemy easily, can destroy the terrorist area and the terrorist. Weapons and arms destroy the feeling of terror among the peoples. If there will be no weapons and arms then the value or the existence of the country will be less and the country will not be in power due to this any other country can easily capture and defeat the country. To maintain the stability of the country, the country should be in power and have good technology based arms and weapons. But all these are very challenging for the human beings to face war.Yes, superpowers on earth wants to conquer the entire world. Everyone wants to rule the country or the world. those who are in superpower will simply want to rule the world. there is occurence of nuclear race in the world. Every country are trying to make more and more nuclear bomb for safety of their country and to win the war. Those country who have more nuclear bomb are came in a category of superpower. For example, America, India, China. there are pros and cons of nuclear race.Pros are we can destroy the terrorist very easily and can easily defeat the enemy.

With the world, people become more serious about this competion. They produce various kinds of arms and weapons because now a days everyone knows that a man alone can not even continue with this race. The important thing is everyone wants to do better in his life. People who can't stand, are called one kind of failure. The competition is useful in the sense of how much one has talent, adaptability power in this new era and in this competition market. People also get killed by the arms and weapons that people make to being forward. This will be better if those weapons can be used for good purpose. People, who have the power to withstand all kinds of resistance, stand in his life as well as in the world.It is true that now a days, people who has greater power want to conquer the entire world. Here greater power in the sense of money, physical power, social power etc. This has some positive sides and some negetive sides.If it is about the positive side, then it is all about what people thinks about one. In this competition people will find many friends and many enemies.If any one has got enemies, then we do not have to think about the negetive sides. If anyone has got enemy, at least he will find a reason to stand up for something, he will find a new way of surviving. People need to think twice before stepping their legs forward.In case of negetive sides, now a days people have to think twice before taking any steps. In this era, people use various types of arms and weapons to cmpete in this world. By taking advantage of others people want to go forward. Sometimes, people get killed for this reason."
292,5,5_284,"The race for the whole mankind is very important to survive in this competitive world. The race has statrted to become the most powerful human or country in the world which has lead to the development of some destructive elements like weapons, social attacks etc...To become poweful one has to dominate others and rule over them. To dominate, humans have created weapons. One having more powerful weapons is having more power. So to establish their leadership, advancement in weapons are done to create more destruction and this lead to neclear weapons to come in picture, the most powerful and harming weapons which can harm many generations living in the area where they are used. We have Hiroshima(Japan) as the live example where orange bomb was dropped. After 30 years of attack childnen are born with some or other physical disorders. This shows that how powerful these nuclear wepons are. They not only harm the people living there but also cause effect on the upcoming generations.The upcoming of nuclear weapons and going into wrong hands like Pakistan, king of North Korea, Bagdadi etc... has created a tremedous treat to humanity. If due to certain circumstatnces if these wepons are used over a large population than there is a big threat to human society. whole countries will be ruined by them.So there is a need to stop the production of wepons like this and protect the present wepons from going into wrong hands. Many organisations have been created to look into the issue but it is the responsibility of all humans to maintain peace and brotherhood. This will minimal the chances of using so destructive weapons. Countries should come together and make rules and regulations for reducing the production of such kind of wepons. All wepons can't be banned because there are always some wrongs elements in the society however this kind of weapons can be eliminated to reduce the risk to humanity and peace."
293,5,5_238,"History reveals thatthere has always been a urge among the mankind to conquer and exercise greater powers. Kings use to attack other kingdoms to conquer and strengthen their power. They use to spend half of their budget on army. The world war in the new world is also one of the the great examples of the nations to gain the position of superpowers. its always seen that there is always a tension between the nations having large defense system, to prove themselves the supreme power. On the other hand the nations with less economy or small defence system are more peacefull than these nations.In the modern era, the nations such as U.S,Russia, China, Germany etc have considered themselves as superpowers. these keep conflicting with each other to prove themself as supreme to other. In the race of being the superpower and conquer the entire worldthese nationshave found and made various types of dangerous weapons. which can blow out the whole humanity in one go. Some of its examples are atom bomb, nuclear bomb, hydrogen bomb etc. With the advancing science and technology nations have made biological weapons, which can weep the entire nation within seconds. one of the example of these is seen when atom bomb was dropped in nagashaki and hirosima during the second world war. the effects can still be seen among the recent generation of the place. every country on the urge of being a super power,is trying to own one of thes weapons. Everyday one threats the other for possessing the nuclear weapons. This has triggered a nuclearrace in the world.Many small nations to strengthen their defense have overlooked the prosperity and development of nation. everyday there is a violence among the people of its own country. hence instead of focusing on onlydefense country should look on development of people and country."
294,5,5_114,"The race of arms and weaponsproduction is definately a challenging for the exixtence of human beings so every country wants to be powerful than other countries by increasing the production of weapons.As we know that weapons are not useful for human life because in just a few seconds the whole world will be destroy.Russia,China,America,Japan are the most powerful countries in the race of production of weapons as well as nuclear weapons.If we produce lots of weapons and nuclear weapons for the sake of ours country but at the same time we forget the humanity so we only think about our increasing production but we dont have to forget what we are producing. Superpowers are also on earth to destruct the entire world like thundering of clouds, earthquakeand brusting of volconic erruption. you have well knew about japan during second world war. Nuclear bombs was launching on the two important cities of nagaikshi and heroshima that time was very difficult for japan but in todays time japan is one of the growing country in every fields whether in education field or development fields.Mostly countries focus on nuclear weapons which are very dangerous in growth of production. Weapons are the essential for countries because it mat only destruction not development in humanity."
295,5,5_346,"In modern world, the production of arms and weapons is concerned with the security of different nations. In order to provide security, every country should have to take these kind of practices. Weapons are as important as the army is. Global world is rapidly increasing the scope of nuclear development due to the safety concerns. As we all know that the attacks can be done vat any time from the enemies ( or a group of enemies).Nations of powerful defence have very high and powerful nuclear power plants. They want to save their country as well. But, the fact is what we are doing with the beauty of the nature? Is this fair with the natural environment? The answer is definitely ""no"". By appliying these practices, we have lost many natural beautiful assets. This also leads to the disasters as well as natural calamities. We can take the example of Kashmir, India. At earlier times, Kashmir was one of the most beautiful state of India. But, due to the various crisis between the two nations, i.e., India and Pakistan, the overall beauty of the state has been lost. Various nuclear power fission practices from Pakistan were done in order to take off Kashmir from India. This lead to state changed from heaven to the hell.According to the survey done by the British Broadcast Channel, in 2003, Nuclear powers will have some pros and cons. They mentioned that these practrices will involve to secure our nation from the group of enemies, that may belong to the other countries. this ideology has become true today. The group made by some people of Iraq and Syria, known as ISIS, wants to destroy the entire world and want to rule in the whole world. The major con of these practices include the disasters in the various parts of the Earth. Superpowers generated by the nuclear energy is rapidly conquering the entire world day by day.We have to organise several social programs in order to reduce the use of such a renewable energy, so that, we can save our remaining natural environment and it's beauty."

Nations that have nuclear weapons are fair less likely to be attacked by the another nation. Even if that other nation as a nuclear assenal. The better nation can be defend it self. That no more risks cannot be placed in that nuclear actions and very essential progressd.2.POWER SUPPLY:Nations that have nuclear weapons that can be benfit for the power and status that comes it benifits. No one wants theair homeland to experiance a nuclear weapon attack and most nations will do weather they can to avoid any conflict that may lead to one. This makes it better for communication and the willingness to listen to one another.3.WAR DETERRENT:Smaller nations can stand a chance of defending themselves against larger nations that have more money and military capabilities when the have nuclear weapons. This can be increase the peace and make it less likely that certain nations will gwt bullied or invaded. Alliances have this same affect when the nation that has nuclear weapons is allied with nations that has nuclear weapons .
297,5,5_133,"Now a days nuclear weapons and arms are the most significant things,the leader of a nation thinks about.So this is leading us towards another world war 3.Actually the cruelty,greediness make a country to do so.Actually this is the worst thing happening to the general person of a nation.Moreover in a country there are lot of stuffs to solve eg.proverty,intternal terrorism etc;but the leaders are not in the mood to eradicate these.They are busy to show off the evil power.Thus they are examining as well as increasing the use of nuclear weapons.The UNESCO tries to ensure the minimum use of nuclear weapons and arms,but they failed miserably.Nations like Nortk korea ,always tries to implement more misciles weapons ignoring the restriction set by UNESCO.In recent days several countries like Pakistan,Afganistan are facing this heavy terrorism.The world has already seen the devastating impact of world war 1&2.Countries in middle east,like congo,kenya etc are the worst sufferers of this.These nation dont have much ecnomical strength.But still they are interested in nuclear than improving proverty.The rate at which the nuclear arms are producing is threatening the whole world.There are not any good effect of this.In the year 2016,now our aim should be to eradicate all internal problems such that corruption,proverty etc. of a nation ."
298,5,5_256,"Now a Days the Countries are emerging with more power ful weapons and in many fields. Not only in weapons and also in nuclear weapons and other categories in respect to the showing to have the control over the world from other countries. Recently we have seen some disasters due to these nuclear wars between China and United States, which results in vast loss of economy and also some loss of human kind in the China. But in this era the countries are very showing their greatness towards this field of wealth in their country. Not only in wealth and also in other fields of research and food resources and all the available food fulling resources. In this modern era the development should in a such away that it would not lead to the destruction but it should be in a human peace and also the eco-friendly. To control the Nuclear wars, some countries in the world are emerges to form a commitee called as UNESCO so as to have some rules to maintain human kind from occuring of wars among countries. By this rules the countries are maintaining some criterias so as to have a development and giving support to each other countries. Super Powers are the also main reason to have the wars among the countries. These super powers are some emerging like Hypnotism and some methods of controlling ourself from other people. Some examples are recently nuclear war of china, and some others. Main these are due to the race in production of armsand some harmful weapons which leads to different types of weapons and challenging the very existence of human beings and these are destucting the mainly mankind among humans. By this nuclear development there are different types of pros rather than pros these results in cons. Some are desruction among areas of countries and a large loss of countries wealth and the effect of the war also remains of longer years."

300,5,5_146,"Earth is a creation of God and everything that is created by God is magnificient. The beautyof the creative work done by the God can not be described in words. He created Earth, human beings, species of flora and fauna and various other elements and powers which are said to be controlled by nature but are actually held in control of 'God'.Human beings, animals might run a race to the top to achieve a certain goalor perhaps for their existence. This race actually help us forego the values that God instilled in each one of us when we were born. For example, nowadays even a 5 year old kid runs a race to come first in his class and when he develops this habit to excel in every work that he does;he might someday wish to excel even by using unfair means, and hence leavebehind the values and beliefs instilled in him by his family. So the race that a 5 year old kid runs is not less than the race ran by our honorable Prime Ministers or Defence Ministers to achieve economic superpower in a race to conquer this world.Superpowers on Earth, are the superpowers not by values but perhaps by the biggest or the greatest economy a country has. One such race is the race to have highest number of nuclear weapons and for this the countries are dying to be a part of various internationally recognised nuclear bodies. Such ""superpower of the Earth"" want to conquer the entire world not by th e"

302,5,5_151,"Race to become more powerful can destroy the entire mankind. today humans have forgotten the meaning of love, all that is important for humans is power which gave birth to the destructive killing machines andnuclear weapons. All countries today want to be more powerful that each other. They finds ways to create more deadliest weapon to use against each other. If war has been declared, every country would try to prove that it is greater than the other, but the entire human race have to suffer the consequenses that will follow. each country try to make their weapons better than their enemy in in turn risk the life of the entire human race.Production of Arms and nuclear weapons also give birth to terrorism. terrorist use weapons to kill innocent peoples which cause terror in society. Government have to take step to control terrorism so they produce fireweapons and nuclear weapons.This race of production of arms and nuclear weapons leads Humansto death for sure irrespective of the country or individual. War always brings death and sorrow. Developed countries like UK and US and creating weapons which can fire from a distance and can damage huge area and kill lots of peoples. terrorist can be eliminated for sure but innocent people will die too as they say ""bombs does'nt have name tags on it""Peace and Harmony is the only solution to stop this Race to procude weapons and nuclears bombs."
303,5,5_404,"In its attempt to harness the power of the atom, mankind has itself in possesions with weapons with unbelievable, destructive power. Nations have the abilities to destroy thousand of cities from miles away, in one minute. These are nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons cost the citizen of UN billions of dollars in taxes each year, the testing and maintainenace of these weapons possess serious maintainenace and health risks., though the actual need of these weapons is not and has not been around for years. For the above reasons, UN & other nuclear powered countries should reduce its nuclear arsenal as its only has life threatening results.Nuclear weapons are generally built for the defense, they derive their power from the energy released when the nucleus breaks. There are different particle decays, viz. alpha,beta,gama. It happens either by fission or fusion. the nucleuys of the atom are collided, and that separates a large amount of energy, that is so destructive that it's radiation can cause severe disasters upto hundred of miles even.We can see from the past, the effects of using nuclear weapons. Hiroshima and Nagasaki , destroyed by UN during WWII. People still there, are born with some physical defects. Cons of nuclear development can be 'cost and maintenance' ;it needs a huge amount of investement for this purpose. Second limitations can be 'environmental impact' and moreover 'lack of morals' ; as if its control is within the hand of some morally devastated, then may jesus helps us. It's physical damage is a matter of concern too.But, since evrything has some pros apart from its cons. This too has a lot, that's helping us in our development. One can be 'Global defense', these are likely key deterrants to major wars flaring up and acts of aggression among rogue nations. Second advantage can be ""power supply"" ; with the pace of development, everyone needs more consumption of power, that is being provided by nuclear power stations. Its advantage can be water deterrent. Furthermore, it aids smaller nations to stand up for their rights against stronger powers.So, overall .everything has results based on how they are used. A proper balance between its advantages and limitations, would help in the development in this race of the whole mankind."
