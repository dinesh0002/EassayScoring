Teachers always want that their students done their work on time in class and whatever task or assignment they given to student they work on that task with honesty and politely and in case they not know or not able to work on that thing then ask them and the teacher suggested him very polietly. Our education system is work properly in privot schools, colleges, institution because in that place all person active for their work and they done resposibility very excelent way they do not think to others. Not opposite but it will not perform good in Government schools, colleges because in that place upper department not saw the work of lower department they free for them for their work it is the that education system not give challenge to private institutions. At present education system run as business no one can say for excellence they were only focus on the more and more percentage. We can try to the focus to the strength of the student not for percentage. When we focus on strength than student efficiently work on the particular area or field, which he like most and he give 100% on that area.

1,1,1_238,"I am agree the tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity.A hidden curriculum can be defined as the lesson that are taught informally,and usually unintentionally in the school and colleges. These include behaviour ,perspectives and attitudes that students pick up while they are at school.This is contrasted with the formal curriculum,such as the courses and activities students participate in,The curriculum began early in the child's education. Students learn to form opinion and ideas about their environment and their classmate.They also learn what is expected of them.These attitudes and ideas are not taught in formal way,but kids absorb them through natural observation and participation in classroom more and more and also participate in social activities.Areas of hidden curriculum in our school that mold perspectives of students deal with issues such as gender,morals,social class,politics and language.Many books and magzine which are related to expected nature at this young age support the idea of today's sepration which are encourage the youths.The importance of boy athletes used to be clear example of hidden curriculum.Student imagination and creativity are also developed by some other activities.Education is the process of facilitating learning,kowledge,skills,belief and habits.Education can take place in formal or informal setting an any experience that has a formative effect on the way one think,feels and acts may be considered educational.Education is more important for every students and children.The influence of this can lead to a negative self image or hatred for reading.These researchers discuss how the student increase the knowledge related to nature and many others areas.Their goal has been to raise the general awareness of hidden education curriculum in our school in order to make education system progressive and accessible to students of all culture ,linguistic and many other areeas which are related to ediucation system.The",4.0

5,1,1_226,I am totally disappointed(Not Agree) with our education system beacause in INDIA there are many fake colleges and universities. In india enemployement is on hike beacause of fake colleges and the low education quality. In western countries the minimum age for applying in post graduation course is 40 to 43 but it's in India is 21 years only. So i want to say that the indian governmant has to increrase the quality of our education system.Indian children are more creative but the resources in our colleges are not properly giving.The colleges are opening for earning money they just want to earn money they don't want to the give the quality of students. In government colleges the condition is so bad the faculty of the government college they do not want to teach in the class . we cannot the teachers only in nows days students also do not want to stay in the class room they are just busyin the social media like whatsapp and facebook. they are distroying their career and they are not sincere about there career they are just breaking the dreams of there parents also.Creative people are not born but they are dovelop by someone or by the own.By the above statement i want to say that we just have to give the motivation and correct direction from the child age.this type of drection and motivation will help that child in young age to choice the correct career in the future and this would be done by the guardian and the teachers also.Government have to make some sort of strict law who they are not performing there duties properly.Government have to give the eucation in the private hands than the quality of the education will definetly increase.,2.0

After the festival of these quizes and mid sem, the bombs of assigment is thrown on students and he/she starts writing and writing them day and night.

This Education system has very less scope of imaginative and creative work space for those students who have very much creative minds full of need ideas.Due to compition level has increased imagination of the students have also become less because of ready made notes provided by faculty of respected institute.Students who have very creative minds are not able to improve there imagination and creativity level due to tough education system due to which they are not able to give time to there creative and imagining mind. Their are very less institutes where such creative minds are made more powerfull and give something new and never scene ideas ever. If the students are doing engineering or medical then there won't be any different things that would entertain them. So importance should not be given only to engineering and medical fields also should be given to Creativity fields and imaginating fields which would bring a balance in our economic growth as well and there would be enough of entertainment shows as well that would be help full for relaxing the frustrated minds.Every field should be equally given importance and keep a balance in our environment as well.Basically Every field is important and is required one or the other day and very much needed in current world which is very vast and fast.Due to which up coming generation can also be very much creative and educative in every manner hence university should promote this fields as well to give a brighter future to every country.,3.5

Education always gives us the basic thought about the life. It is compulsory for all to be educated. But imagination and creativity is such a thing which is beyond our education. It certainly move forward the new genaration and mankind.For a student, education is the foremost thing in his daily life. But beyond the boundary of education there is a new area of study new things are imagination and creativity. For a student, I can think that a bookish education always prefare the knowledge which was invented by some one else. But they have no scope to create new things. So for me, Education always give such an oppertunities to do but not to do such things which is beyond education. According to me, Education build presure to a student to do bookish study. But imagination and creativity always to be prefered one of the top most things in daily life. Imagination of new thinking always create new such thing which is never use by anyone and might helps people to do effortless work. I can think about the new technologies in various stream of education. Ican think about various composition of music in musical education, various technical ways for various play like cricket, football etc., various movement of dancing, various creative games in the andriod version. These are never built by anyone and it is always beyond of the daily lifew education.Theyoung genaration always thing about the creative things and it will make successful in their daily life. It will helps us to move forward in the new genaration of education. With that it also helps us to do certain thing in progress with the technological mankind. The new generation always move forward and study beyond the bookish education and always think about the creative things.",3.0

27,1,1_200,Iam strongly agree with this statement tha our tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity. We can see the example in both the college and school life. In the School life many boards like ICSE and state boards had alot of syllabus and more than 7 subjects in the primary standards. Students of primary standards in ICSE board used to take bags weighing more then the students weight and this shows the burden of the tight schedules on the students. Schools used to give more and more assignments and homeworks to the students due to which students can't get the time to play and to do extra activities. CBSE board had done alot to minimize the tight curriculum of the studies and it also helped alot in the extra-curriculum development of students of CBSE. Students should given value based knowledge and they should be treated as friends. The new activities involved by the CBSE in place of assignments is giving alot of knowledge related to working projects to the students. As this is the era of technology and one should have the good knowledge of using those technologies. Student should have knowledge to implement the technology into projects and students can do this only when the curriculum of study and syllabus is turned liberal. Another reason is the attendance as in our country attendance is mandatory for the students and this is the only reason behind the less progress of the studentsb of engineering. Engineering students should be forced from their first year to concentrate on value based projects and the value based knowledges. Hence according to me this tightly definrd curriculum of our education system should be turned liberal and students should be given value based knowledge. value based knowledge is compulsory.,3.0

Sometimes teachers provides lots of work tothe childrens so they wont get time to think more about their work . the education system should not be much tight if u want to see new creations or imagination . Imagination leads to the successful ideas and ideas leads to the innovation ,creation.the should should be kept free to imagine because imagination is something whichn can create the world around us.The system sometimes strict is good whenever it comes upon the disciplibne or regularity , rules and regulation.the way useed to trate students must be polite to know what they actually feels or to let them imagine the world around them to find something creative. we should keep students feel free to make their thinking ability marvelous. the education system need not to be much strict if india wants to grow because these childrens are future .Prepare future not to demolish.",3.0
48,1,1_318,"Creativity is doing things in a different way. In India creativity has been maligned, neglected, and misunderstood. But its finally coming into its own. A growing belief in the need to attend to learning beyond classroom if educational achievement is to rise and if people orientation andskills base isto remain relevant to the economy. A desire to ensure that schools and college life is marked by reasonable behaviour and is attractive to potential students. I do not think that our educational system leaves no room for creativity. Nowadays, right from the school days teachers r stressing and encouraging students to be creative apart from education. People must understand the definition of hard work and smart work.Hard work is the largest distance from source to destination and smart work is the smallest distance. To do this smart work you need to be more creative. Parents are the primary cause for their children's life as they play the key role players who wants their child to be the best in the world. Parents nowadays have understood that apart from education children needs creativity. They have understood that the narrowing of the focus of classrooms teachers and lecturers particularly as they deal with increased workloads and the national curriculam. Thus people should give much stress on creativity. Teaching and learning should engage with big ideas, key processes, modes of discourse and narrativeness of subjects so that they understand whats constitutes quality and standards in particular domains.That is why they are admitting their children to the instituitions where they can get complete knowledge of education including creativity. Professors in colleges always encourage the students to do things in a different way and indulge themselves in different scientific works. The science laboratories in colleges and schools are well equipped with different instruments from where the students can get many scientific ideas.",4.5

Children now a days don't enjoy education rather they take it as a heavy task to be completed. This is because of the tightly defined curriculum that is followed in schools now a days. A tight curriculum does not provide oppurtunities to grow , it rather confines children to limited tasks. A tightly defined curriculum does not provide the exposure required for experiencing the beauty of education. Students now a days study only for passing the exam and not to gain knowledge from the subjects . Gaining only text knowledge does not provide the room for creativity rather children loose their sense of creativity as they are required to study only the subjects which are present in their curriculum. If they would have been given the practical knowledge or more exposure then their minds would have been more creative. they would have been able to imagine more things rather than confining themselves to the subject matter. There is a need to create an education system in which students are exposed to the practical knowledge and also where students are not only forced to pass the test but to know the need or the reason to strudy thje subject so that they can actually apply the knowledge of the subject in real life. A tightly defined curriculum is in no way helping to children to become creative but it is confining or limituing the thoughts of children to a certain extent.",3.0

Some of the practices include implementing the things taught in schools than just exams, more focus on real life projects and freedom to exceed in any path the student aspires.Students spend most of their time preparing and giving exams with very less time left to explore knowledge.

Education is the most important thing in life that a child needs.Educating a single child leads to great help to the overall population of the country.Education system should not be a tightly defined , it should always be away for the child to grow, prosper and flourish his creativity.It should not be the which leaves a child behind because of the tight curriculum of the schools. Achild should be given chance to speak what he wants to, and they should be given to chance to express themselves as much as they can. Every child has got a creative and innovative mind, only the thing is they should be allowed to deliver their thoughts.If the schools are working with a tight curriculum, it somehow dicourages a student from delivering what he actually can. A friendly atmosphere in schools will help them grow up much faster and to a great extent. A teacher or guide should always be a friend of the student, so that they can share their thoughts and feelings with them.A tight curriculum puts the students behind, and with such system their imagination power also is affected to an extent. A child should get a creative environment, studies are not the only thing that can help a child grow but there should be some extra curricular activities for the students so that they can show thier talent, rather they can actually find their talents with these activities.The education system should be partly strict as well as kept partly free , so that student never hesitate in sharing what they feel.

55,1,1_107,SUMMARY- firslty i want to say that i am fully agree with this statement. education system of india is very good and effective but nowadays which is necessary is not in curriculam. because these era totaly depended on practicle knowledge and it is very necessary to every student that from starting point of study every student try to read something practicle.INTRODUCTION- The education system of india is not more practicle so student never think out of the schdules. and this era want to think OUT OF THE BOX. because every job want from you a Smart Work and smart work comes from practicle knowledge.REASON- The main reason is the student maintality never think about the more things only focus of student towards the marks knowledge and it isnot sufficient. and the big reason is that student only focus on time table which is given by college or university never focus on extra things because student wants to occures only good marks. and the big problem is that teacher also never think the practicle knowledge because they work for only money. but after seeing all these things all colleges try to organised the development classes.SOLUTION- this is very big problem and need to very clearify solution because its the future of the every country. firstly my suggestion regarding this problem is that initiation should bo good. means from the first classes suggest all the student that think out of the box. and never pressurise for any work which student never want. and in high education colleges try to conduct the more SEMINAR and PRACTICLE CLASSES and WORK SHOP and COMPETITION to raise the personnel interest.And the system of providing the job should be changed that grading regarding marks. because all student think for the job.,3.0

Students thinks that if we going for the creative things it will affects on our grades. Education system have to give the space or motivation for the creative things.

60,1,1_75,The tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity is somewat accurate and exact. The defined schedule don't allow us to imagine for different areas of life. Always being around a definate schedule makes a man dull. Hard Work and no play makes a man dull. It has been alwyas said that we should always do something creative around or imagine for different and new innovative ideas. These ideas not only help us in refreshing our minds or for some entertainment but also gives us flexibility to do more work and recharges human body. To be defined in strict schedule makes a man annoying after a definate interval of time. Sometimes the person tries or thinks to give up for such things. He make himself very irritating and represents himself or herself as a boring person. The curriculm should be defined in such a way so that one should enjoy the life along with the studies. One should be given that much of time so that he or she could feel good about what is happening around him or her and could think something imaginative or creative for nature or for anything around him he feels for. If one is given time all after his schedule than one loves to live and enjoy the life but if the strict schedule is defined for him he gets irritated and leaves all comfort of life thinking how boring life is. Schedule must be defined but in such a way so that one not only enjoys the concepts of life but also imagine something great and creative for his or for upcoming generation. Imagination and creativity gives a happy life which one can lead. It makes the mind to think more creative and imaginative for even simple things around. There are so many examples around us which shows how great imagination and cretivity can be. They explore our minds to different areas of life and allows our minds to think in various directions without any restrictions. They make us feel doing great without any obstacle for being creative and imaginative. This idea not only explore us but also keep us being interactive with others for our beautiful ideas. So having such type of ideas without strict schedule are very appreciative around everyone.,3.0
61,1,1_219,"I do agree to the point that the tightly defined education system leaves no room and time as well for the imagination and creativity.our education system is so tightly defined that all day long we are busy to follow our one schedule only. In some countries like India, America it is mandatory to have a college degree to get a job where as that in Germany students are free to follow the course and curriculum of their choice and can dream their future according to their choices. In German countries people go with the courses like electrician,carpentary, chef if they are not willing to go to the college or cannot afford it. And as the outcome Germany holds 81% of employed youth which is much more higher than the other countries. And no one can doubt on the progress and development of Germany.In the present scenario, all that matters is the educated, awared and emplyed youth for which one really needs not to owe a degree from a well acknowledged oragnization. It just requires knowledge and keen interest. Because this interest and talent leads to success not the college degrees.As a student, I always felt that why i have to study the subjects in which I am least interesed. I agree that basic knowledge in every stream is a good thing but after some why those classes and subjects were imposed on me.Indian system of education badly needs a reform which very much important for the youth of the nation. As the youth of today id the future of tomorrow. And to make the upcoming future of the country more sparklingand bright one actually not requires a college degree with worth praising grades.

They use eight hours of student in the college to teach them. after that there is no any other time remain to do other activity.We need to do other activities to improve our imagination. we need some extra time, but there is no choices to do because lack of timing. Student life is very important life becouse that life we learn many importanat thing, we improve our communication skill, imagination, etc. We need a time for thinking and for doing other activities in our life otherwise college should provide a free time in a college or school to do that.Now days the compition is very high so we need to improve our extra knowldge, communication skils , etc., but there is no extra time is given to us to do so.

My eduction system does not give skill eduction. our most eduction are based on theoretical knowledge . so student are running only for marks. they do not have knowledge to thier subject but have a good marks. one research says that student should not be restricted by the curriculm of eduction system becaouse creativity can not come in mind when you are in pressure it come's only when you are free. when you have enough time to think.

The pressure of subjects and different studies also stepped up gradually and we started to forget that there is a time scheduled for us to play in 24 hours.From the infane stage parents wantthat children will be a famous doctor,engineer or scientist in future. But no one thinks that if the child can do better in playground then that isa part of their success. Rather they put much pressure If you want to grow upconcentrate on study. Do better result that will serve you better salary and better future. So they schedule time for home study, coaching centre, home tutor etc. One must have to genious. Our regular education system also support this and they put a pressure of attendance, home assignment, tight examination schedule etc. It starts from school days to college.

66,1,1_207,"I think, this is absolutely correct. It is because the tightly defined curriculum of our education system has a tight bound, so we don't get enough time for creativity or imagination of other things. Fot that reason the creativity of the people have been ditoriated. So, the job or project works level is decreased. The creativity is very much important in student life. It grow the mental preparation from the childhood. If creativity is made, only then the new things will be created. By imagination, new things will be discovered and so the country will go forward. If one student imagine in a high level then the friends also take interest from it and, by sharing idea new things will created. For example, in 100years ago, people use paper for storing important imformation, but now they use computers, mobile to store their important data. Is it not a creativity? I think, it is a huge creativity which helps all people for their daily life. Internet is also a creativity, which helps people for knowing new things all over the world by seating any where he wants. If the imagination power is not created in people's mind then this is not possible to get new things everyday.But in daily schedule of the students, they don't take much time for imagination. They are busy for their exams which is held every months. They also take pressure for those exam because this numbers of the exams will added at the final exam. So, they become busy for the coaching classes and bookish study. If the school or college authority can reduce the pressure from their students, this may hel[p for developing their country as well.The present students don't get time for playing as they are busy for their packed schedulethen for where the get free time for their imagination.

If there is no base, the person may not think about the variations. It is necessary to open the boundary of our mind and think out of the box. Education teaches the discipline and ettiquetes and enhances the thinking skills.Nowadays Education is overburdened on the school kids as well as the higer students, which create pressure on the students to complete the assignments and projects before the deadlines. They cannot think about things apart from subjective studies.I think the emphasis should be given on the current awareness and General Knowledge rather than the subjects as it creates more knowledge and it will open the limits of the mind.So it should be kept in mind that the education must be taken as a BRIDGE to create imagination and creativity inside the brain of students.

68,1,1_86,The tightly define curriculum of our education leaves no room for imagination and creativity.I think one time student are totally blank to think about that student feel the pressure that first we have attempt those question they are kmow and think about otherquestion one time they are take a pressure then the effect are we are know those question we are falling down.these time we are solving the paper at presence of mind we are attempt all the question .I think these time imagination and creativity are loss in few mins.but the imagination and creativity comes then we are solve the tightly define curriculam at least passing number. but the tightly defined curriculam of our education system are wrong it is effect by student and ours carrier and it is also effect the records.but its has two effect positive and negative . positive means the student prepare the exams by see the last year exam. but those who are facing the tightli define curriculam of our education are not prepare .but those student are good in education we are solving any type of curriculam of our education.educationsystem are importrant for student because we are define right curriculam. and we are define the curriculam in syllabus then every school and collage are prepare and giving the education by syllabus and teacher giving the extra knoeledge about the syllabue.,1.5
69,1,1_173,"In the modern era of education system the daily schedule of schools are in such a way that students only get sticked to the scheduled subjects and the teaching process is also in such a manner that teachers teach only about how to get good marks in examination. They actually do not teach but they teach how to solve questions and get marks. learning process is not implemented on the students because one a great man said,learning requires thinking. So therefore the thought process of the students get vanishes by the current education system.As we know in the ancient period ingurukul system the guru (teacher) teaches his students(shishya) about the life about respect about society and other essential things which are required for the perticular child and teachers make them to learn by implementing practical situations so that they could be able to think what is the situation and how to get solved.So in modern period or in current senerio the board of education system and the politicians should implement a curriculum for students in such a manner that they not only deal with the theoritical knowledge or they should not get sticked to the schedule but also they could be able to implement the theoritical knowledge practically. there after they could be able to grab the real knowledge and could be able to think about innovations i.e. they get innovative mind. so teachers should not only concentrate about how the child will get the good marks but they shpould concentrate about how the delivering the right knowledge to the students and what is really happening in the nature about science, society, and other things. Thenonly the coming generation will be able to think different. Hence I am in favor of the above statement that,the tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity.",3.5

Our knowledge gets shrinked as we move higher. Our knowledege is tested on what we study and not what we are capable of doing. The topics, methods to teach, time allocation to teach, number of assignments, number of practicals etc, everything are mentioned and we abide to follow that rule only. Due to which only machines are generated from every college and not the human being. The students are present in classroom only physically and not mentally.The above mentioned things leaves no room for imagination and creativity. There has to be a change in the education system to improve our caliber to think, to increase our wisdom of knowledge. The following changes our required to make our education system better and the best.In todays education system more preferences should be given to practical knowledge rather than theory. Classroom should be made more of like interactive session, less burden of assignments should be given and more of practicals works like projects, presentation, group discussion and personal interviews should be held. So that a students can increase their horizon to the next level.Rules should be present but in a healthy manner taking students point of view. These are changes are only possible when we all become one. Though we are divided into different religion and caste but we are united by a single knot i.e. India.One should never forget that the sky is not the limit and one should always thing beyound his or her capacity.

72,1,1_94,The existing cirriculum in India is inefficient to manage millions of illiterate population. We have been witnessing the upcoming changes only after there exist a reason to compel few changes in our education. There are few elements in the society which favours this system. Those who are beneficiaries of the existing system are reluctant to change with times. There is a vast majority of the people who loook at the education system as a hurdle to uprising spring of innovation.This attitude has made us think of a series of efforts an individual can pursue outside the existing system. A drop out candidate with a successful outcome makes us feel that there is still a space for innovation beyond the boundaries of the existing system. An enviornment with open thinking process beyond our syllabus is something which every individual needs for his overall development. Lacking behind the times makes us inefficient in terms of the work we do throughout our life. We cannot sense the importance of the need of every hour which is been wasted to a limited targets of work.The present scenario in the global market is difficult to predict with the expected future at the one end and reality at the other. Therefore an individual cannot limit itself to one profession. For this it is necessary to bear a flexible mindset regarding education and its future perspective. The current reality is that our universities could not cope up with the challenges of effecient way ofdiversity and its effects across every individual.A digital initiative can help us in achieving different goals in a much comprehensive manner to cope up with international standards. It is important to monitor every upcoming changes the world is witnessing and to cope up with that the existing institution should be integrated in a digital way.,4.5
73,1,1_209,"I think our Education System is not that hectic. Along with studies we have provided with a better platform to express our extra curricular activities.There are so many facilities are also provided by the institutes to the students so that they can easily get the opportunities to show their inside talent to the outside world. Like now days students who are interested in dancing, singing, acting and other cultural activities, for them several cultural events have been organized by the institutes. And moreover some talented students have been promoted to the National as well as International events for their particular field of interest. Even the students who are good at sports,for them also various sports kits are provided by the institutes. Also the other things like jim, yoga centers,meditation facilities are also provided for the students.    We have given a complete freedom to think freely and imagine the things which we like to. Some brilliant students who are very great at their studies are given with all facilities to think and do the things practically. These kind of students are always motivated by the faculty persons as well as by the entire department. So in our education system also students are encourages to do whatever they like to do. They never forced to indulge in any think in which they are not interested. every kind of talent is motivated by the institutes. whether it can be field of study or any other field. The only difference is that students should come forward by themselves with their talent because there is no body who took him from the crowd of students. they should have to come forward by themselves. Then only institutes or their teachers will be able to encourage them in their field of interest .",3.5

In order to make child bright in every field be it in studies or in sports schools follows a tightly defined curriculum. This curriculum is made such that ther e is no time left for imagination and be creative. Students have to attend schools for about 8 hours a day and then given loads of homework.Schools give importance to studies more than anything. also the parents today wants their ward to score higher in studies. Thus they are deprived af creative work and forced to do studies in order to compete with others.Even if they do something creative and imagines something it is called a waste many times and they are discouraged to do so. Education system is such that a child who is not good at studies is given punishment by failing him. even his other activities are not given importance if he is not good at studies.Even when there are holidays they are given loads of homework thus leaving no room for imagination and creativity.Due to these children today are depressed and which is adversely affecting their health.Also failure in studies many times lead to certain wrong decions.

77,1,1_190,"IMPACT OF EDUCATION SYSTEM ON IMAGINATION AND CREATIVITYI totaly agree with the fact that the our current eduction system has an adverse impact on the imagination and creativity. eduction system is so tight that no time is left for a student to think new , he / she always keeps on thinking about thier studies all the time ..Beyond that they have notime left for their own recreation and development . They are always stressed under the homeworks and assignment to be completed by the deadline. Imagination and creativity always come in a fresh and cool mind . It requires a good platform to think new and be creative . It comes in cool and a silent place like park , greenery or any silent place . Students now a day have no time foe their own recreation and enjoyment as they always have the burden of the tight curriculam of the current education system , they always keep on running behind the marks and percentage . Today the education system is very tight due to its budy schedule , non stop clases from morning to evening . In addition to the school today tution and coaching centres have played their own roles , they are also considered as an important part of today education system . Almost after school hours the student needs to go to these tutions and coaching centres for their beter studies and doubt clearement . The students these days are hactic and busy in schools and tutions . They are not able to spend time for themselves as imaginationa and creativity need time to build . Yoga , gym , exercises keeps the body fit and fine and mind cool and sharp hence help in building new ideas and creating something new apart from studies. Students should take at leat 1 hour from thier busy schedule for these activities .",2.5
78,1,1_328,"As our education system is 80-90% theory based,so its obvious that the practical knowledge of the students is ess.The practicals conducted in the laboratories are not enough to understand the each and every concept of the theory based knowledge.Hence to understand the each and every concept of the theory knowledge,it is essential to understand the practical concepts.If we look to introduce the practical knowledge more,that is about 50-60% then the theoretical knowledge is not needed to be mugged up as the students do nowadays.While performing the practicals or any site visits the students will be learned the whole knowledge of the subjects just by watching and understanding the things on the site.Due to this kind of theoretical knowledge that we are getting we are upto the level of books only to understand the concepts.Ourminds are not in a level up to imagine some further things to be done or how this concepts are been made actually.So in short,the knowledge given is very deep but in absence of practicals which the students cant mug up.      The projects or tasks nowadays offered in colleges are generally available on the internet.So, the students are just copying and pasting the stuffs available on the internet.Each student has a different creative mind,but due to the current education system the creativity is hidden and doesn't comeup.The imagination and creativity are directly proportional to each other as the imaginion increases the creavity increases.If the students starts imagining the concepts in their studies then the projects which were copiedand pasted will be done by the students imagination and creative mind.       so in short i disagree with the current education system and think that it needs to be improved as for the better future for the students and better understanding ofthe students.It needs to be drastically changed as soon as possible.It will be a great thing if this system changes.",3.5
79,1,1_70,the tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity. Aswe are living in a competative era where everyone wants to be at peak of successin which our education system plays very important role. But nowadays curriculum of our education system leaves no rooms for imagination which means that we have a pre decided curriculum through out the session. which donot give the enhence to our imagination and creativity which is more important for life apart from the basic knowledge. Some time it bounds the imagination and creativity of the student. In my view there should be a good combination of defined curriculum and imagination and creative things. the class room education shoud be flexible enough so that student can show their creativity and imagination while study. it has been observed that student learn better through activities rather than the traditional way of learning. in higher eduction it is necessary to understand the things in a practical way which can not be possible in pre decided curriculum. there shoud be donesome extra curriculum activities to motivate the student. so education system should be change and adopt new things according to the need of student.,3.5
80,1,1_316,"Creativity: It's been maligned, neglected, and misunderstood. But it's funally coming into its own. Here, creativity expert Sir Ken Robinson makes the case for creativity as the crucial 21st century skill we'll need to solve today's pressing problems. Sir Ken led the British government's 1998 advisory committee on creative and cultural education and was knighted in 2003 for his achievements. His most recent book, The Element (Viking Adult, 2009), looks at human creativity and education. He is also the author of Out of Our Minds: Learning to Be Creative (Capstone Publishing Limited,2001).Both creativity and critical thinking have been flagged as essential 21st century skills, yet some people think of them as being as separate as oil and water.What's your take?It's interesting that people see creativity and critical thinking as being opposed. It's partly because people associate creativity with being totally free and unstructured. But what we really have to get hold of is the idea that you can't be crative if you don't do something.You can be creative in math, science, music, dance, cuisine, teaching, running a family, or engineering. Because creativity is a process of having original ideas that have value. A big part of being creative is looking for new ways of doing things within whatever acitvity you're involved in. If you're a creative chef, for exampel, then your originally is going to be judged in terms of cuisine. There's no point applying the criteria of modern jazz to somebody who's trying to create a new souffle.A creative process may begin with a flash of a new idea or with a hunch. It may just start a snoodling around with a problem, getting some fresh ideas along the way. It's a process, not a single event, an dgenuine creative processes involve critical thinking as well as imaginative insights and fresh ideas.",4.0

In modern Indian education system,we have to appear in lots of exam in short period of time and lots of assignments are given. The pressure is huge for the student gives no space for knowledge. We are forceed to study the bookish knowlege. That is not good for the student. We have to focus in the imagination in creativity. Whatever we studied. We have to focus in practical knowlege. What we are studied that are related to system. We have focus on this. We have to comapared every thing we studied to our system. Bookish knowledge are not enough because in industries we have to solve the practical problem realted to industries. We have to studied for knowlege its complete from imagination patially.Now a days, students are busy in their daily life. Due to loots of pressure they can't focus correctly. Examination system should be changed.If anyone have an interest science he have to studied histroy forcely by our education syatem. There are lots of compition are inbuilted to the students afe of 8-10 years. That is not good for them. Other than this family pressure is huge. If a students marks is decrese in any paper family gives him a huge pressue.Now a days, students have lots of extra curicullar activities other than studies. That is also hampered. We have to come in a point to design our education system inproper ways. We are know that marks doesnot determine merits. It's proved by many examples. Sir Newton failed in mathematics in school days but he was a greatest scientist. Rabindranath Tagore was a great poet. He got novel in 1913 but he didn't jion any school.At last I would like to conclude with a given statement of Thomas Alva Edison that he once said that a piece of paper can never decide anyone future.",3.5

Most of the time their schedule is like-1.get up2.get ready3.get school.4.after comming from school go coaching class5.do homework6.sleepand this cycle repeats itself.and parents also force their children to perform well in their academics which in turn result as a burden on child mind and thus leaves no space for creativity.The same thing goes with adult students which are in universities and colleges.They spend most of their time preparing for competitions and getting a good job.Most of the time a good job is measured by salart it provideds and not by the ineterst of the person doing the job.Mos tof the people ends working the jobs they dont even like and thus result in frustating life and no imagination and creativity.This is one of the reasons why India is behind in research areas.Our education system does not provide facility and time to have imagination and creativity in it.Education system should work in this area.schools should provide some extra time for childrens to work on the things they like instead of forcing them to achieve marks.one should be able to specialise in the area of interest instead of doing normal graduation which includes things they don't like.We should take example of foreign universities where students can select the subjects and majors they want to study saparately and change the education system accordingly to need.These canges are necessary and will contribute to conuntry growth.",3.0

Human mind follows a certain pattern which they are made to follow, if the mind is only made to follow to mug up the things, rather thinking anything crative or using imaginations then it will limit itself to certain areas only.A brain is fully developed if it uses all of its perspectives, whether it is imagination or creation of something using ideas. Students at their very young age starts developing their minds, their mind starts making patterns of learning things, if in such situation if the learning centers will follow a strict curriculum which does not have any space for imagination and creativity, then the students cannot fully develop their brain rightfully. For students to have their brain fully developed in all perspectives of learning be it imaginative field, or creative field it is necessary to design a curriculum in such a way that it includes all the portions of proper learning and brain development. The Education system has to be more responsible, more encourageable towards imaginative and creative ways of learning. For creating a beneficial and effective curriculum for students, different surveys are needed to be carried out so that a well planned curriculum can be designed.Students should be given a fair chance to explore the imaginative and creative side of their brains, so that they can develop themselves into a more focused, more brilliant and talented individuals.

Also it helps increase the literacy rate of India,but it is also seen that the education system is lacking in practical knowledge as there is no time for completion of it. One only learns through the books and tries to imply in real ife,but it is not possible practically sometimes. The law and order must be made and revised so as to acknowledge everyone about the happenings of the world and literacy. Also steps must be taken to imply Strict rule and regulations for passing the exam. One of the most important thing or change that can be brought in this system is to give practical knowledge more than theorotical one. This makes better understanding for the future. e.g- you dont read books for riding a bicycle, u just practise and learn to drive. Similarily this this should be there in our education system. This will also increase the potential of every individual to learn and understand things by doing it himself.",3.5
93,1,1_191,"Imagination is the mother of invention and without imagination we cannot create new things. In my opinion the present structure of curriculam has degraded the students imagination and creating new things. The present trend of education has only focused on getting marks in the examination and if you are not able to get good marks in the examination then everyone questions your ability. Now only marks matters to everyone and not about acquiring proper knowledge. India is currently very poor in publishing new journals and our neighbouring country China regularly publishing new journals. There is a reason behind India's failure in publishing new journals and the main culprit is the education system where from our parents to our teacher to the society everyone always gives focus on how much marks we are acquiring and not about getting proper knowledge about the subject. Our education system is now producing robots who always want to have all the things spoon feeded. A well known industrialist Mr. Azim Premji recently told that the new generation that is coming out are not fit enough to lead the industry and help in building new India. In my opinion the entire education system needs to be changed such that we should produce human beings and not the robots. I think the government of India should come up with a new idea such that the maximum focus of the students are on creativity and imagination not on just acquiring bookish knowledge. The bookish knowledge will only help us in the education life and not in the future. Our Prime Minister also started Make In India project , start up india and several other schemes which can be successful only when our youth should get proper education and not just merely bookish knowledge.",5.0

But now a days there are no educational gap and all students are tightly defined curriculam of their own education. All the schools, colleges are instructed to complete their limited syllabus, but in our beautiful world there are many things to know and to learn. A student should know all the beautiful thingns. But our educational system is not enough good to do this. India is a developing country but the infrastucture of education is not good for do anything to do another tasks that this our out of syllabus or out of our educational system. We have to change it otherwise the people suffer. A student should be inovative and creative because a student is the future of our cuntry. A student should know all things that is related to our life and should improve the general knowledge about our world.In our current system this is impossible. Our current education has huge and boring syllabus and one student have no interest to learn this types of lessons. So we have to improve it and make it more interesting.

The new CCE pattern which was introduced in schools was a great step towards children's overall development .This new pattern of education involves various things regarding students development.But the sad fact is ,it's not implemented properly in each and every schools. Schools gives us a chance to explore ourselves. It totally depends on indiviual ,how they respond to the things.Students must participate in every cultural activities,sports,quiz whatever be held in school.This would help indiviually to devlop as a student,it also helps to enhance their personality.But off course the time limit of school must be shortened .this would cause a little harm to the students, they don't get sufficient time to do their own things.Children's want to do a lot of things .But their tight schedule of school ,their homework,project etc .They don't get their free time to pursue their hobbies.Now a days children's were like working people in a office,as they have a 8-2 job.

All of their target is to get high class degree and settle in abroad with a huge amount of salary.A student at the end of the day after 3 tuitions a day, 6 hours of school college is exhausted and one can hardly expect creativity from him. Yes educational qualification is important but it should not be a boring one. Education system can itself be a creative one. For that our Government should take some steps, like lab works, project works, exhibition, talent hunt, quiz, where a student will perform his creativeness.

This is because we have been taught since childhoodthat we need money to survive. And how do we get that money?

The aspects worth continuing should be carried forward whereas obsolete techniques should be changed and replaced with advanced and innovative methods.Emphasis should be laid on creativity and equal importance should be given to all subjects whether Science or Humanities. No child should be made to feel as being less intelligent than his peers because he is more creative and likes Art more than Physics.

114,1,1_161,India has always been the country of great people but from last few years we have seen that there is no more innovation and creativity left and i think it is because of our tightly defined education system.Our system does not leave any room for creativity the country which had people like Mahatma Gandhi a great visionary are now missing from the society.Itotally disagree with defined system and oppose it .the current education system does not leave any space for vision or the contribution of the students the strictly defined rules and regulations for curriculum are imposed on the students and henceforth the imagination or the creativity of the person is lost.If we want to change our nationthe change should start from the education system.every educational board in the country whether state or central has a defined structure for student of every class to force them to study in the subjects they want to or not. and then they are forced to perform on the subjects causing mental issues with the students.Students are like clay we can mould them the way we want if we start to make them use there imagination and creativity to work on things and then try to mould them in what they want to do we can create a great nation with people of great ideas and imagination any nation is born on it's peope if we need a great nation we need great people. At last i would say that no nation can be big untill it has a system of crushing ideas and enforcing them to do the things based on a defined structure no great people our born on the stricted enviorment.the system needs to change to create a better tomorrow for the nation and it's people.,3.5

Education is the must for each and every individual in the whole world. Government is also taking many steps to encourage education for those who cannot afford it. Various new schools are being set up for poor children whose parents cant even able to afford a two times meal for their families. Mid-day-meals are provided to such poor children during school hours.  Their are loan facilities that are introduced by banks for education purpose. These are just to encourage education. There are many life changing examples of people like a father is a tea seller and his son becomes a great businessman just because he is dedicated to his studies. It also changes one' way of thinking and takes the level of thinking and level of imagination to the next level.  Various schemes were introduced by Government just to engcourage education.

The only thing that students learn from school and colleges are the text book lines and the leactures of teachers, students do not even get the time to come out of those lectures and think about creativity and making something creative needs the individual to grow up reasearching about a particular topic or matter which needs time.

Some time after exam finishes, student won't able to answer many questions because, they only remember that syllabus only for sometimes to get high scores in exams.The first solution of this problem is that teachers teaches the students in a new way like to correlate the syllabus to the daily things that we always remember so that student will also remember that things and never forget that study.The second solution is that teacher teaches the student with the help of technology like with the presentation in the computer to provide them a real live example with respect to the syllabus, so that student able to understand the things that how stuff works, etc.In colleges, we have to make the student able to get a industry exposure from the first year, so that student able to know that how things are done in industries so they are able to modify his study according to the industry needs, that is what industries want from a freshers.Also, college curriculum shoulod be change and be just like student do 70 percent practical work and 30 percent theoretical work, so that student able to answer and knows, how to do research and development work in any subject in which he/she will have interest.

Most of the students they just learn as it is and copy in their exams ,there are just few students who understand the subject and write in their own words. As a result mind of such students grows to some extent but the others students remain upto that level itself. As the studies tells that the people at their growing age i.e in their school time can learn a lot rather than in their adulthood. So what i believe is that students are given chance or to have a subject in school time in which they can do their imagination and show their creativity to build up their minds to certain extent. In India the education system is far beyond that the students get the chance to study about their intrested subjects after their high school . The second issue of our education system is that we are taught 80% theoratical subject till our graduation and only 20% practicles which loose intrest in students for studies. They are no more intreseted only to ready and write rather they prefer to do practicles which woulld help them to build their intrest in education.so according to me there should be such subject in school time also where students can use thier imagination and creativity which would ultimatily would help to the the students and our society . as we see in other countries where students are taught their intrested subjects in their schooling. and same would be helpfull to our students also.",4.0

Here thestudents are bound to learned how to memorized some words and data and by putting them in a paper how to get good grades to take a job outside of this country. But we have the device named calculator to store that things then why a student 'll waste their vital learning period for memorizing that things? There is no answer for our Education system!Now time has been come to change this pattern for education system for future progress .Most of the time should be spendedto develop the skill of a new learner from their school level by providing them proper guidence and scope. There should be a scope for discussion new ideas among them according to their imagination level and ideas should be corrected and developed by the appropriate mentor. The day we will start that possible things in practicaly we will forward one step for better and progressive nation among the world.

Some changes are good but some are not.Earlier the main focus was knowledge. Students did'nt get the readymade things.

It is optional for the student to opt home exam or baord exam. Most of the student opt home exam and they not study properly and get good marks.

Our need is to check human nature and according to that we should choose the curriculum, every thing has positive and negative side, depending our nature we should think what should be the curriculum.So, idea is, to analyze the human being then decide what to do, what should be the curriculum. For analyzingthe human nature, you can go for personality test and we can ask same questions in multiple ways, and test what is that person, what is his real personality.Analyzing the personality of a person is very improtant task because we can not decide what is good or bad for that person, what he like and dislike, if we analyze the personality of a person then take decison, it is benificial to him and as well as for us, after all we are analyzing him for our company. So make sure our analysis is correct and have accuracy, because correct analysis will take correct decision. Correct analysis can give best result.If in case we don't do this work effectively then it might be harmful for our companyand as well as that person also.So atlast i wanna say what should be the curriculum, itjust depend on the human nature. We should make sure our analysis which we're doing on that person should be correct, because every person can't do work with same curriculum, correct analysis give best result to our company.",2.5

Imagination developed in free fields. Imagination developed with an open mind, a mind where zero stress or tension finds. Education is important and creativity is more important because education provide anyone a job in a company which will going satisfy any individual needs but imagination and creativity makes a company owner.For the sack of society an individual forcefully complete its education but when its come to use it that person is not capable of doing that.Education now a days are done forcefully because of society. that's why students are being so stressed because of that.

So if our defined curriculum is tight based on more theory or even the practicality of tasks are limited within the time frame and the course content, then that curriculum leaves no rrom for imagination. The imagination of how to do the work or complete the task can be improved by the teaching ablity of the teacher i.e. how much a teacher is flexible between the thoery and practical and how he can relate thiungs to surroundings so that students can learn form surroundings and can improve the thinking abitliy. The tight curriculum will only have more theory or a defined module within which the student have to perform or think the solutions than it is quite difficult for anyone to improve the imagination and creativity.The curriculum should be rather flexible not tight. A flexible curriculum can easily suggest the module to ave few theory classes, few practical subjects and then applying both the knowledge to solve the problem. There can also be interactive classes where students can put thier imagiantions in front of the teachers or the industry person and present thier ideas in front of them. the disadvantage of a tight curriculum can be that the knowledge will be just based on books or teacher's note and the imagination part can be lost out.In my final expression i would like to suggest that the curriculum should be properly schedule with both the book theory and with some interactive sessions and practical exposures for students.",4.5

It makes the huge difference between the generations knowledge. In todays time the institutes are only intake the students only for making money. They are not take the interest in making the future of the students. Let us take the example , of Engineering, in engineering colleges the students are now get admitted via management quota and the think that now no need to study. They complet the four years of engineering and still unemployeed after completed the engineering . This is just because of the incomplete knowledge given the the teachers of that institute. In institutes the studies are going only by the flow or prospective of the syllabus which is decided by the Universities or by the colleges. No one thinks about the innovation only , not for the knowledge. Due to this old thinking syllabus students are not aware from the latest technologies and not going to spread their imagination or their creativities just because of the high load of assignments , Tutorials, and many such more extra or waste activities which are loaded on students preassuresly .If the government changes the rules of all the colleges and make the syllabus of all the colleges matched with the IIT's then someting better can be done by the youth studentsor by the upcoming generation. The current education system harms the youngs and no innovation to the students who are other than iit's or such type of institutes.I just give my opinion that to make the place in Developed Country from developing country we have chage our education system and stop the dirty politics which is going on this time.

We lack in producing creative minds because we teach the children to just to grasp whatever is listed in the books rather than understanding it.

There are pre-defined strict curriculum that is mandatory for each and every student to pass in order to get into higher classes. It leaves no room for new things to be practised. Until and unless the students would be left free to do things at their own, the new and creative ideas would not be invented. For the modernization, our society wants fresh and creative ideas and energetic students to work towards it.For this we should improvise our education system so that our students could learn more and more.

We all know that creativity is the stairsof success and imagination leads to creativity. But in the present scenario the eduaction system is not focusing on the student's imagination and creativity. Education system is only forcing students to get good marks not the knowledge in a practical manner.  Today's education system is focusing only on the marks and theoritical knowledge. Education sytem isnot doing anything forthe practical knowledge of the students. Since schools and colleges are only concerned about their writeen notes, assignments &amp;tutorials, so the students are also becoming a writing master by doing all these. There are so much written work which students get from schools &amp; colleges as a homework so they are not getting time for their extra activites.

Most of the institutions has been started to overcome this tightly defined curriculum education system and started new concepts which helps to loosing the tightly defined curriculum; we have seen that most of the institutions make harder schedules and time table for their students, by which students getting hurdles in their imagnations and creativity.For being imaginative and creative, they have to compromise or manage their schedules. In my views, institutes has to take some common steps to overcome the burden so that students can manage their schedule and will work in all skills and fields simultaneously. We have seen that day by day students getting developed in thier skills so we have to provide some opportunity to students, so institutions can lead the education system perfectly; not only that our government have also contribute to this issue by establishing common institutions for skill development system for better education system.",3.0

Taking the education system of India into consideration , India is a large country with a mix of people from various culture and religion.All these people as students go thorugh the process of education given by the education system.The education system has to be imposed in a proper and complete way to ensure that the people get the best education .But in case of India the education system is not well reformed as it is in other countries . the students have a lot of pressure to handle as the education system is not so reflexive as it needs to be.the heavy load of bags and homework which leaves no room for imagination .the rigorous school hours comprising of tight schedules sometimes lead a student nowhere.this is all because of the eduacaiton system. In this tender age of growth and learning , the student gets loaded with completing homeworks and assignment leaving a small room for imagination.The education system should be laid in such a way that it leads to overall development of a child both mentally and physically. the children should be left free for doing what they like which is progressive for them.",3.0

192,1,1_202,"I truly agree with this statement, because today's education system in India is basically working on guidelines and regulations that were imparted to our education system years before. The students in our country are just getting trained and not getting educated. Parent's of our society have a tendency of comparing their wards with other students who score higher grades. Our education system is like a circus, where a lion is also asked to dance and drift, we call that lion well trained, not well educated. This major drawback of our country leaves no room for imagination and creativity. What I think is, till class 1st there should not be any marking system, the students should be taught manners and attributes, so that they should know how to behave in the society. I also oppose the grading system of our society, because it is defining a range of students with 80% marks and 89% marks an equal grade. This makes the student with 80% marks overconfident and 89% marks student annoyed, because both of them do not have any differentiations in marks, but definitely have difference in IQ level. Also the caste reservations system of our society, have made higher intelligence students inferior with those who make profit through these policies. I strongly recommend stopping these reservation policies. Since students of our society are being only trained, not getting educated, also leaves no room for imagination and creativity. These students only dream of getting good grades, so that they can show their parents and society, a healthy REPORT CARD. I honestly respect students who are capable enough of generating good ideas, so that they can establish themselves differently from the trained students, and make our society a good place to live. Foreign countries are hiring our educated students, and trained students are working in this country only. This is the main reason why the economy of our country is lagging from other countries.

We just keep on following what has always been going on and there isn't actually anybody who is looking forward to change the system. As a student myself, I have faced it. There are a lot many school and colleges in our country which just focuses on the marks (in numericals) you have attained. There are just few repititive questions which you have to mug up and score welland that's all what you need to be a good Ebngineer or Doctor or etc., This certainly is not something that is going to help us in coming years, where all the countries are in a rush to beat each other with there technical advancements, we definitly will be lagging behind.Yet there are certain schools and colleges appearingthese days which focuses more on an overall personality developement rather than some mug-up system. They have set their standards high like providing the international level of education. Making the children learn multiple languages, relying more on practical developement etc,.

According to the research, it has come to know that the students having less boundations become more innovative and productive in their life. A student should develop his all areas rather than to be better only in education. Boundations limits the naturality of the student and leads them to follow the same rules and regulations as followed by others. Student only remains in the defines area thus does not able to think beyond.Enough time should be given to the students to think what to do.

In this period of time a strict curriculum lays a foundation for the students to stay updated and focused towards their studies.At the same time,we have found that this education system has lead to variousdisadvantages. Such as,it leads no roomfor creativity and imagination.Students become bookworm and their only target is to score good marks. This has resulted in making the student's mind blunt.

220,1,1_222,"I completely agree with the given statement . To justify my point i would first like to put some light on the current scenario of the education system. The present education system has only defined syllabus , confined thinking and moreover students are made to gulp the entire facts rather than studying the logic behind such facts . Hence , it leads to a tightly defined curriculum leaving no space for creativity and imagination.Expressing my thoughts on the view , a perfect education system is one in which a student first explores the field he is good at . Rather than studying physics and chemistry or learning the aspects of history . If a student find himself good at arts and craft he should pursue that as his carrer . Curbing the imagination of a student leads to stress the student and ultimately end to his talent .Imagination and creativity are the basics of any invention . If there is no imagination there is no invention .The main reason why India is lacking is terms of invention is this UNFRUITFUL EDUCATION SYSTEM . Inspite of having brilliant brains India lacks in this stream .If students are exposed to more thinking rather than mugging facts then surely India will turn out to be the epitome of inventons .Nurturing and supporting those brains flooded with revolutionary thinking can make India stand apart from other countries .It should rather be made mandatory for students to explore theirtalents. Teachers and parents should help the students to realize their worth. Research field in India also lacks growth , since the child from its birth has never been exposed to thinking so he finds it difficult to enter the research sector. Giving space to imagination will lead to a different India .",4.5

Students have lost their capacity of creation simply because our teaching methods dont stimulate innovation and creativity.Creativity isn't a test to take ,a skill to learn or a program to develop.

Our education system only leads us, it is not leading us toward the inventions or toward the innovations . But for the inventions ansd innovations we have to think out of the box ,we have to think out of the room and out of the books.so it can be said that in todays, our education system is a tightly definned curriculum which leaves no space for imaginations , innovations and creativity.",2.0

These rules makes us limited to specific things.when we are in college we just study to pass exams or get jobs in reputed organisation.Our knowledge becomes limited.People fear to take risks .They think that if they will not follow the educational system they will not be able to succeed .So we are only limited to bookish knowledge and the fact is that we are also not able to implement this knowledge practically.Due to this our imagination is going worse day by day .In college we just utilize our time in doing useless things like assignments,tutorials which everybody knows we copy from others.Thus we can say that we are not creative nowadays.We all have watched the movie three idiots .There two types of successful persons are shown .One who just follow the education system perfectly and one who shows his creativity .But the person who iis creative is more satisfied and successful.Thus our education system makes us handicapped to creativity and imagination.We all know that hard work is very important to succeed in life but hard work one done smartly leads to creativity and imagination.We should have rules but it should be imposed optimally so that best output is achieved.Our education system needs to be modified so that we should be more creative.Some upgradation in the education system should be there so that we should think freely on topics.Our bookish knowledge should be linked with the real world so that new ideas can come up.Thus in the end i want to conclude by saying that creativity is very important for achieving kn",4.5

Parents do not encourage there chlidren to follow there dreams and show there creativity in different sections but put forward them to study the well defined courses like engineering ,doctory, accountant etc. Instead of asking what they want to do witn there life. In addition to that india's education system do not give students a good practical knowledge or encourage there experimental side but give them theortical knowledge only due to this they donot seek into world of new things and inventions. As education system of other countries is far better then our country ,students move to other country for better study and to give thier dreams a better way. India's education system should review the syllabus of every field so that student can taught the new things of changing world and so that students can coup up with new technologies. Syllabus taught today is not reviewed since last 5-6 years ,so students are lacking behind from other country students in every respect.Education System should adapt some changes and provide students better education with good opractical knowledge and invest on students with there education and provide investment on experimental ideas of students so that they can contribute to the new technology of coming world.

But due to our education system a person doesn't get time other than books andassignments. Now a days a kid of 10 years he wake up early in morning and starts learning the chapters which were tought in previous classes. After that he gets ready for the school. Approx after 7 hours he comes back with some homework. In a day he gets only 2 to 3 free hours. In that three hours he has to use social networks as well as some time for television also. My point is that it is affecting the interaction of small kid or youth which is blocking the individual minds at some extent. This is very harmful situation for future. If we take the example of engineering only what problem a person face during this course. There are two semesters in a year, each of 6 month. Atleast three mid semester exams, each contain six subject. and a univerity exam which takes about one month, and a holyday of one month after exam. Every engineer face this problem. He does not get chance to think about something innovative or creative. He used to with the same senerio. This reduces the human interaction and results in increase time on social networks. Which ultimatly makes a man shy in nature, he can not express himself in front of anyone.Education is the basic block in an individual life, but the defined curriculum activities makes a man similar to others. A man with different mind start changing and adopting the environment of his surrounding. Tightly defined curriculum is simply killing the minds of a person, it should be changed in such a way that a person with different abilities get chance to work in his area of interest.",3.5

Accoording to me it is important to have a healthy competetion but the present trends is becoming more dengerous what we think of.Tightly bound of education nature creates a bad path for learning.Most of the people who are involve in it are suffering from it.I found very bad for little kids they have run with other rather learning very hemonic way.Learning is art and the system which gives it or provides it,should be more serious about it. The present situation is so bad that students are not really keen to learn.They just donig racing and only full their memory with heavy staff, which is very bad as per my intelegency.Now there is no space of imagination and creativity for this system.

So every one moving towards gaining high marks in eaxmination by any how.So the actual education losses its space .  In conclussion I can say that we should look towards the present education system and try to modify it , so that the involved persons can understand what is a quality education is.We should look towards the quality education rather quantatative education.And try to create a obese space for crativity and imagination.Lastly I can say that we want a healty competetion rather racing without thinking.At the last I would like to end with the speech of great person...thinking creates immagination, immagination creates knowledge, knowledge makes a person greate._A.P.Jabdul kala.",3.0

239,1,1_287,"Education is of one the basic needs of an indiviual. Good educational background always provide an extra edge. But what is education really? Is it something which a child mugs up just to make it through the exams or is it something that noruishes our mind. The matter of concern is that even after spending around 20 years of life in studying most people do not know what they want from life. And some lucky ducks who already have it all figured out are not able to perform accordingly. At times the reason is lack of appreciation given to imagination and creativity. Most parents wants their child to be either an engineer or a doctor. For girls it is often stereotypes like 'become a teacher' or 'look for a govenment job'. But are we not forgetting the fact that we can not afford everyone to be an engineer or doctor. We need musicians, chefs, artists, sportsmen, directors as much as we need engineers in our society. It is time to change how our minds are socially nourished because encouraging children from the start to follow their hearts and to be more creative can save us from all the stereotypes.There are things beyond the academics and this is does not mean that one have to be bad at studies, no sir! You can be outstanding in academics and still become a music director or be in fashion industry. The education system needs to be reformed and focus on things beyond just bookish knowledge. Of course basic education is necessary but the focus should not be how much did one score in exams, instead it should be on what are we learning and how will it benefit us. According to a survey conducted in Oxford, 47% of our education is worthless. That is HUGE! What does this tell us? Is it not an eye opener? It is time to bring positive changes not just in our education system but also in our society.It is time to accept that an indiviual is not defined by their report cards, they are defined by their ability and passion and the fire in them for something which keeps them going!",4.5

This curriculam binds them to a constraint area.

No one can excel in a work in which he is not having interest.To remove this hypocratic thought and to make young generation excel, we have to change our education system.

If we give more pressure to the student, then they can not think freely to solve a problem. So we can't block their imagination. To maintain it we should think according to their way. Like which think they really want to do, then focus on that. If the student get some benefits from that then it will help his or her mind to free. One preffered example is that, the great poet Rabindranath Tagore loves to teach the students underneeth of nature.

The education system is so scheduled that there are many theory subjects in the curriculum and the practicals are very much less. Sthdents not get enough time in the practical classes due to tight curriculum and there is no room for imagination and creativity because from practical classes students learn new things. Students just learn the topics to score well in the exam but they lack imagination and creative power. According to me the education System is so designed that there must be a scope of more practical classes that give students the oppurtunity to think and makes threm creative. parents and teachers should not give enough pressure for marks in the exam but should think about the student imagination power. Projects should be provided by the school or college on new and creative topics so that students think about the topic and build their imagination and creative power. The curriculum must include those subjects that helps the student to think new and creative thoughts.

Many people write about ways to change education, but what good has it done if we are leaving out the voice of the students?

A development paln which makes us believe that a educated man can achieve anything which he desires for.A lot of research is done before choosing the school and a lot of investment is also planned ahead. There is a predetermined apiration in the mind of the parents that their son or daughter is going to become an Engineer or Doctor or a Lawyer, or some of the highest positions which they might have heard of in the country. But hardly they notice what the child wants to become, what is his/ her area of inerest or the area in which he/she can excel. And the education system in India is to blame for, the education system which has a set curriculum in all the boards of education, focuses only on the syllabus rather than focussing on developing creativity and innovation and imagination. The child only focuses on what is taught in schools and what is in books, rather than what is the real cause behind or how can things be better or different solutions for a given problem.I, competely agree that the tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity. This is the main reason that in India their are less numbers of Entrepreneurs, sports persons and people in other fileds. For example, in olympics India hardly wins Gold, It has to settle mainly for bronze, thid happens because there are no facilities provided for the players. No proper coaching facililty, no proper diet plan, no proper trainers are provided, due to which this happens, also earlier schools did'nt provide sports facilities and this goes not only to sports but to every fields. This happens firstly due to stricly defined curriculums and also parents not supporting the child to fullfil his/her dreams.Hence, the education system in India should be changed and more focuss should be given on what excites the child rather than forcing him to follow the curriculum.

285,2,2_146,The increasing gap between rich and poor is plaguaing our society today is as true as The rich are becoming richer and poor are becoming poorer. Now a days the situation of society is such that where if a person has money he can have everything and hence the rich people do not think before investing money and there by the price of every itemhas increased drastically. On the other handa person who is not wealthy enough has to pay more money in order to survive and full fill his needs.The main reason behind the increasing prices is that the person having money can spend it anywhere without thinking of the affect that the poor or middle class people will have to bear. Ofcourse if the person is capable of spending money he can but businesspeople do not think of others and keep on increasing price so that they can earn more and more money. The result of which has to be borne by poor people. They may not be able to collect the amount of money in prder to full fill the basicneeds.In a country like India half the population do nothave shelter they have to spend their nights at railway station or on roads since they do not have money so that they can cope with the increasing price of todays world. There are millions of people who go without food for days because of the price that keeps on increasing day by day.Also the attituide of rich people towards poor is such that they do not treat them like human beings and also do not give the salary to their servents as they deserve to get.More than half of the population on earth suffers from this gap between rich and poor. One step taken by Indian government to reduce this gap is to demolish the use of 500 and 1000 currencynotes so as to eradicate the black money of rich people. This step will however have good impact on the country and must be able to reduce this gap.,2.5

Many factors like black money, corruption, illegal activities make this happen. Its true that one man cannot change this situation alone. Every country needs honest men to serve the country in the form of government. If the government is not honest, a country`s poor man will never get stable or healthy earnings. It starts from the top and effects the people in bottom. The first measure is to remove the dirty politicians from the government. Secondy black money, which is another big reason for this situation. Black money is basically the unaccounted wealth of a person which has no records in the eyes of government. Because of black money, government`s cash rotation struggles and the common man faces high taxes in order to compensate that rotation. If that unaccounted money is recovered, a lot of people will have employement and business will go. Overall its a growth for country`s economy if black money is recovered. Which directly benefits the poor and decreases the gap between both. Another measure is to make strict laws regarding the same. If a country acts strict on corruption and black money, there would be no poor. At the end i would say the truth that its really hard to fill that gap for now.

It&#039;s true that half of Earth&#039;s wealth lies in hand of one percent of its people while quarter of the population cannot feed itself a day&#039;s meal. There are many reasons for economic inequality within societies and they are often interrelated. The main factors which affect economic inequality include, but are not limited to:1. Inequality in salary.2. Salary gap between highly skilled employee and low skilled employee.3. Globalisation.4. Education.5. Racism.6. Gender.7. Culture etc.Inequality has widened beacuse of these above factors and technological change have made most people less competitive, while making the best educated more competitive. The tasks most people used to do can be done more cheaply by lower paid workers.Basically government initiatives to reduce economic inequality include:1. Public education : Increasing the supply of skilled employee and reducing income inequality due to education differences. 2. Progressive taxation : The rich are taxed proportionally more than poor , reducing the amount of income inequality in society.3. Minimum wage legislation : raising the income of the poorest employees with  minimum or taxfree salary.4. Nationalisation or subsidization of products : providing goods and services that everyone needs cheaply and freely ( such as food, healthcare and housing), government can effectively raise the purchasing power of the poorer members of society.Apart from government , we can also narrow down the gap betwwen rich and poor .

Mr. Modi encourged rural sector people to open their bank accounts with JAN DHAN YOJNA. This way many rural sector population is having bank accounts and this way they now know how to operate their bank accounts.Not only this Mr Modi has started Digital india so as to connect the rural population with the urban population.This will encourge the rural sector to learn.Many industries are being set up in rural sector and this will help in employment generation.

303,2,2_76,"There is no doubt that the gap between the rich and poor is plaguing our society today! The rich people are getting richer day by day and the poor people are becoming more poor day by day. There are lot of reasons behind this.In a country like America, a person without a car is considered as poor whereas in the countries like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, owning a car is a luxury. The developed countries have good economy, GDP and people live a standard and healty life. Where as the devloping and under developed countries are still strugling with the economy, low GDP and most of the people live a rock bottom life.In countries like Nigeria, Syria, Iraq etc. people are dying because of hunger and on the other hand in western countries, people are wasting food like anything. This is because of the lack of stable government and intruduction of other countries into these middle eastern countries.This major problem can be solved to an extent if the richer people pay the taxes to the government at regular intervals.This will make the government rich and it can help the poor by arranging various plans for the poor and needy.As we the middle class and high class people should do charity to help the poor at least once a year, as the muslims give away2.5 percent of their property and belongings to the poor every year as charity so that the gap between rich and poor would be filled.And the corruption also plays a major role in this, as the government executes plans for the poors and releases money, by the time it is reached to the poor it will be a half.Therefore, the gap can be reduced to an extent.",3.0

Beacuse they not able to study and earn livelihood properly they do not contribute towards the society.I am sure if government will take neccessary steps for the betterment of poor people by providing free education provinding neccessary funding for livelihood and by proving jobs the livelihood of the poor people will change in the long run and they will be able to compite with the rich peoples.,2.5

On the other hand, these people are not not aware about the government daily wage plan so whatever they are given its is justifiedand the officials takes the benefit of it. Employment is a bigger challenge for them to find and the expected rate they do not get. If these people will not be taken care of they the country like India cannot be economically powewrful. For Economic Sustainability government has to look for everybody.Consequences of this problem is that government has to make different plan and schemesfor these people and spread it through newspaper, radio, television and other sources so that they also get the benefit of it. Indian Government has to spread awareness among the people so that it reaches to all and people around are benefitted. Transparency hasbecome mandatory now, it will be easier for these people to survive because now the payment are done electronically, hard transactions are minized which will help in reducing corruption and providing benefit and money can be easily distributed amopng the people.

This is the setuation where no equality is present.The total system is fevering the rich people to become more richer and on the otherside the poorer gets morepoor. This system give a space for the rich one where it is very strict for the poor one. We do not find any system which provides equity rather than equality.For this currupted system the consequenceismore people enlist their name inpoor list. Where some people opposed for their foods on other side somebody is not able to earn enough food.The government should give his all valuable attention for this. As each and every human being is the part of this country. They should not always give the faver tothe richer one. They should think same way for the poorer. When vote is in market this political person gives hope to the poor public but as voting is completed the just forget them. It should not be in this system anymore.

Half of the Earth's wealth lies in the hands of one percent of its people while a quarter of population cannot feed itself a day's meal. Most of the population in India is below poverty line. The reason for the growing poverty can be the lack of education and awareness among poor people. Since , poor people are not educated they dont even know their fundamental rights. Also the resources of earth are not equally distributed among them. Because of lack of knowledge among poor people , the rich people always exploit the poors. The poor people in India are more indulged in crimes to fulfill their basic needs instad of doing jobs . Because of black money in oour country rich people are becoming more richer and poor people are becoming more poor. Child labour in our country is also one of the root cause of poverty in our country.The consequense of the widening gap between rich and poor can be that there is an increase in the crime rate and also the rate of suicides per year. Many farmers who are poor and had taken loan for their growing their crops do suicide beacuse they were not able to safeguard their produce beacuse of lack of knowledge and resources. Also the poor are a burden on country as they are increasing unemployment rate in India. There is exploitation of poor by the rich people in terms of giving wages or working hours etc.There can be a lot of remedial steps for the problem of gap between rich and poor. government should introduce more litracy programs so that the future generation should be litrate and able to find work for the livelihood.

312,2,2_126,"The increasing gap between rich and poor is plaguing our society todayThe gap between the poor and the rich has strected to its widest levels since time memorial. Economic inequality consists of the differences in the income and wealth distrbution. Typically the term, the gap between poor and rich refers to inequality among groups and individuals in the society, but can as well refer to inequality among countries. The gap between the poor and rich is related to the concept of equlality: opportunity equality and outcome equality.There are severaln reasons why there is a growing gap between the poor and rich within societies. These reasons normally are interrelated. The major factors that are seen to affect the growing gap include innate ability, culture, education, globalization, labor markets, policy, taxes reforms, gender, inequality in salaries and wages. A major cause of the growing gap between the poor and rich with modern economies is the wage determination by the capitalist market. The job wages are deteremined by demand and supply in the capitalist market. For instance, in a situation where there are many workers who are willing to do a job for desirable time, the the supply of labor will be high for that job. On the other hand, there will be a low demand for a job in case there are few persons willing to do the job. When the supplyis high and the demand is low for a job, there will be a low wage.Apart from this market related factors which impact the inequality of the wages, government faciliated initiatives can as well decrease or increase inequality. Policy markers and social scientists debate the effectiveness and relative merits of every strategy of inequality regulation.Implementation of progessive taxation that will be result to rich being taxed relatively more as compared to the poor; hence the amount of income inequality in society will be reduced.In conclusion, the rend whereby only the rich become rich can be resolved or reversed by putting more emphasis on financial literacy, education and investing in bhuman capital, but this is not expected to be effected within the next decaden because the growing divide between the poor and the rich in most countries such as USA is worsening because of the manner in which the resources are allocated.",4.0

For example, government started a monthly railway ticket for a amount of twenty five rupees for the really poor peoples. But this facilities is used by the rich peoples instead of the really poor people, actually the really poor people does not able to use the facilities given for them. The rich peoples kept their large amount of black money in either swiss bank account or in the share market.

So as these are all not our mistakes,se should cope up with the disgrace that all we have own from the god. In this day to day life ,due to the certain circumcstances that are happening which differentiates between the rich and the poor has been ruined our society from the ancient times only. Actually we cannot go on searching what actually the cause for this fact. As it is mentioned that half of the earth's wealth lies in one percent of the people while a quarter of the population cannot feed itself a day's meal ,I completely agree with this statement there are 55% of the nations are still underdeveloped and 23% of the nations are developing and only 22% of the nations are developed.The main reasons for this problem are *.scarcity of education, *.misconceptions in the people about seperation of richness and poorness, *.jenuine growth in the wealthy atmosphere from the childhood which certainly leads to avoid poor people in the near future,*.improper guidence from the parents, *.lack of proper meals in the government schools for poor children ....etcMy response for this situation is 1) there should be proper education for all the common people in the society right from the beginning of their childhood to understand the disablings of the poor2)people should learn to avoid the discrimination between the rich and poor as we all the children of the god3)atleast one should know the fact of feeling for the poor and needy people will become nearer to the god4)there should be certain yojanas should be provided by the ruling government to serve the needy and poor5)government should provide compulsory minimum education to the poor and underdeveloped children and provide minimum daily wages for backward people6)and more over this ,one should understand the fact of life in their minds that 'this life is not permanent and we all are temporary in this contemporary world and try to look all are equal and feel for poor lead the life happily'hence ,one should understand to look god in each and everyone and feel the happiness to lead the successfull life without encouraging rich and discouraging poor and this can be a permanent remedy",3.0

328,2,2_97,The reason for the disparity between rich and poor lies in the total history of that nation. The incresing gap between the rich and the poor is beacause of the nation policy of development and its social and cultural importance. when the goal of the bussiness is all about the gain and loss this will still grow. As money has the property of attraction it gets accumulated in the hands of rich and gets away from the poor. it also implies us that all the individuals are not equipped with the same well of skill set and oppertunity. to narraticate this problem the concept of money and the progress of the individual should shift from wealth to happy. There are only wary few countries which measure there progerss by happiness and not by the wealth. this is the time that aleast now the people should be able recognise the importance of the human well beging rather on gathering the money.constuctive effects should be made by the govenments all well as by the individals in see that such system of growth should be brought so that the disparity between the rich and the poor comes down. it is shame on our part that we encouraged his thought pattern along years. the govenment should bring in activities and schemes that bring the gao down. people should be made part of such process and they should be educated in such patterns of thinging.,3.5

The population of the people living in villages is growing at ann enormous rate.Onereasonbehind the increase of population isthe lack of entertainment sources for people living in rural areas. As the people living in villages have not enough work to do, so they pass their time doing intercourse.This way they feel like actually doing something worth, rather than wasting time doing absolutely nothing.We can clearly see four to sixkids in most of the families living in villages. In this way, they feel like actually giving something to the world their own contribution.The consequences of increasing population are lack of employment. Due to the increase in the population, the people find hard to find jobs, because there is less demandthan the supply.

There is no standard measure of inequality, but most indicators suggest it slowed or fell during the financial crisis and is now growing again. This inequality is a threat to economic growth. This is partly because there is a wider gap in education in different areas, which leads to a less effective workforce. The reason for growing inequality is the growth in whatit calls notstandard work, which includes temporary contracts and self-employment. you often hear inequality has widened because globalization and technological change have made most people less competitive. while making the best educated more competitive. There is some truth to this . The tasks most people used to do can now be done more cheaply by lower-paid workers abroad or b computer driven machines.The redistribution of the collected taxes is not happening properly. collecting the money from rich and utilizing them for the betterment or reduction in poverty can definitely bring a change in the gap between poor and rich.

By doing this we can avoid atleast one child from poverty. Education is the best solution for avoiding poverty and differentiating rich and poor. so if each rich people adopt atleast two to threee child, then within 10 years there will be no poor people at all. so this is the best solution. And if government makes some laws then also the problem can be avoided. Because laws cannot be braoken by common people, even though they are not interested.And even the poor people should not get fear of rich people, and even rich person should not think they are great, they can do anything for the poor people. once rich people are punishable for there illegal activities and harrasment on poor people then definetly in future we dont have any problem reagarding differentiating rich and poor. so its all depends on the people and the governmentThank you",3.0

The major concern is that almost half of the earth's wealth is in the hands of the one per ecnt of its people and the rest are poor who are not even in a condition to feed themselves.The gap between rich and poor can never be completelyeradicated from the societyas the rich don't want to help the poors and the poor are not in the condition to help themselves. Governemnet takes initiatives to help the poor and provide them funds and several NGO's are taking further steps to reach the poor and help them. But this can't be sufficient unless the rich takes the initative and help eradicate poverty from the society as they are the one who have a dominant role in the society and one forward step from them will have a greater impact on the society. The other way in which the gap between poor and rich can be decreased is by providing employment. As the poor will be employed they will not be dependent on others and can have their meals. The poor needs to understand that if they are born in a poor family that doesn't mean that they need to die in a poor family, they should to something for themselves and no one can act as a hindrance in their growth process.If every section of the society works together with the government and the NGO's then the gap between rich and poor wiil be eradicated completely .

The education is also in lower class society is not too largely spread or their is a lack of higher studies in lower society cause they can not afford the heigher education cost.We can see there are many examples like our President Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam who is also from the lower society, who have struggle a lot to get achieve a sucess. but the oppourtunity of of getting things are very narrower in the lower society.

The steps taken by the Indian government against this problem is appreciable. Proper taxes must me addressed to those who are falling under criteria. But the problem here is that most of the rich people are able to escape these heavy taxes by lurring. As a matter of fact, rules must be made strict for those who are having unauthorisedsources of income. In order to uplift the poors from their situations, various campanges should be started. One of these campanges like SKILL INDIA is being initiated by our prime minister, where people are trained to develop their skills in respective fields and thereby helping in increasing awareness about the society and also increasing the sources of income.Other extra efforts by the rich peoples can be made, like doing social activities to uplift the society.

Rich and upper class continue to become more richer.Suicides is one of the many consequences of the increasing gap between rich and the poor. The poor suffer everywhere, even when it comes to gaining education. Though educational and health programmes and many other efforts are being taken by the Indian Government but it still seems not enough. One of the reason this gap between the rich and poor is increasing is Illiteracy. If the poor will be literate then the chances of there being exploited will decrease which will help in bridging this gap.Laws should be followed strictly, especially taxation laws. Everyone should pay genuine tax and this can be first step towards the equal distribution of wealth among rich and poor. Government has come up with many remedies, for example: Every Individual both rich and poor have been allotted with a unique identification number and have their bank accounts connected with this unique identification number. This will help in tracking and circulation of currency which will help in reduction of black money and this in turn will help in an increase in GDP of India and this can prove to be an aid to bridging the gap between the rich and the poor.Along with the efforts of the Government, every individual in the society also needs to contribute towards this plaguing problem of our society. with the combined efforts of Government and the society India can deal with this problem effectively and this will also aid the economy of India and it will be a positive step towards becoming a developed economy.",3.5

Well i support the later one , it is the gap which is produced by the society. Richer are getting rich and poorer cant say about them. Some find really difficult to earn their bread. Lots of these people are dying because of the unemployment, economical issues and many more. Its not that government is not doing anything for them , but the output is still not visible. After 70 years of independence we are still fighting for our rights.India is a wealthy country but its wealth is going to that part of the society which is already capable enough to run an empire . The gap has been crossing the limit. Every day we hear a news of farmers hanging oneself in the name of debits , or coming under rails . This death rates are increasing day by day. This gap is not just harming our present but the future image is terrible. We have to avoid this scenario for our betterment, for our society, for our people .We can try to reduce this gap , we can try to give life to them who are actually fighting for it. Certain measures are there to reduce the line between poor and rich . The very first thing which comes in our mind is that to ban corruption .Doing this will definitely decrease the line between the people. Also other measure can be worked like helping NGOs and serving needy people , producing employment to them etc.These are some general steps which are used to reduce the line and then we can step into the Equal India",3.0

371,2,2_222,"Poverty is the lack of resourcses to obtain goods and services to maintain marginal living standards. People who are little above or totally below the poverty line are considered as poor people. These people are normally unable to obtain one time meal, shelter, clothes, and education. Poverty is not native to just undeveloped and developing countries, but also to developed countries. Two leading causes of poverty are globalization and lack of technology to harness resources. Although Poverty is not a new problem of the society, it has been more rapidly growing due to globalization. Globalization had a huge impact on the world through increase in trade, development in communication, and exchange of cultural values. As the economies rapidly grew, the more traditional industries such as crafts, handlooms started vanishing. These industries used to employ highest number of people who now became unemployed.Now, people who work in these industries do not have the required skill and eduction set to work in new industries such as IT, Management, or Engineering. Harnessing natural resources and trading them, developes an economy and reduces poverty in simple terms. In fourth-world countries like Africa, the problem lies in the lack or inability to harness the countrie&#039;s huge reservior of resoures. The best solution to poverty is public policies to encourage businesses and international policies of wealth distribution among nations.",2.5

The main thing is that wasting of food.Unnessarly some people are wasting their food they are not giving who are starved.so this must be stopped the govenment should take some steps to stop this gap.First of all the government increase the rations for the poor people and stop giving rations to the rich. And make the rules of paying tax who are having more than 20lakhs per year pay tax of 50% . reduces the salaries of politiciansIncrease the tax on licqer and other banned product.One can think before wasting their food that it is required for others and eat how much you want before placing the food to your plate.

The reason for this is their is no effective rlues and regulations, if the rules are good and followed effectively by everyone without any bias there will be a great change in the society. Here the people with the higher positions are transfering their roles to their family members only not allowing others to have achance, for example the political leaders are transfering their position to their sons or daughters like in congress government and not only in politics but also in the high level companies like MNC's the board people are transfering their authority to their family members only like in Tata group.One of theremedy for the problem was that caste system has to be eliminated in the society by thatall the people will get equal chances to get the higher level jobs,for example thelow caste people like SC and ST are getting jobs under reservation not actually they all are poor being in the higher positionsthey are only earning more than the other caste people like OC. For OC's to get a higher position in the society like in Group's exams the cut off for them is nearly 60% wereas for SCand ST the cut off is about nearly 40% only here shows the difference in the people.The another remedy is that the government has to count ech and every rupee earning by the people of the country by that there will not be any black money so that the money supply will be more in the market then the prices of the products will be low so that the middle income people can save money for future.",2.5

The money that have in large amount is of no use now, as the government of India has declared the 500 and 1000 notes invalid. This news is less affected for the poor people as whatever money they have, will not be wasted or will be declared as invalid. The society should themselves stop creating this difference.

As we all know that for a basiceducation we needmoney and different resources. Poor people are not onlyempty hands, they are not even aware about the different policies which government has decided for the education of the children.The main problem is the awareness, lack of awareness in the people results in this type of situations.

The advertiseent of these policies should be there where it is required and children of poor people needs to be educated.

Even the rich one use their money and power to insult poor and sometimes to make them homeless by taking their property at low rates and than selling it at high rates which makes the poor more poor and rich more rich. I think the poor people must be given their whole right they should be treated equally as the rich one's are treated, people should change their mind set which is set that if a person is poor he can be easily disrespected and some times even this poorness of the people leads to do wrong things they dont do it itentionally but this problem forces them to do so.

On the other hand, one of the factors limiting the growth in inequality has been the increasing number of women working. As it was We have to think about soaking the rich.

The gap between the rich and the poor has increased and is plaguing the society.There are plenty of reasons to state for this increasing gap but the major ones include corruption, failure to implement the formulated policies and a i don't care attitude among the wealthy section of the society. The government wants to bridge this gap between the rich nad the poor but it can not be achieved until and unless we all start working towards it. There are policies which are formulated to bridge this gap but people are so involved into corruption and black money, that gap instead of dimnishing has increased and we dont even realise that ultimately we are the who are affected by this increasing gap.Only 1% people are holding the wealth, the rest cannot even feed themselves a day's meal. so, if this gap needs to be bridged there needs to rules and policies set and implementation of these policies to be checked. There is need to formulate different policies to handle the inflation problem and something needs to be done to remove corruption. What Mr. Narendra Modi has done today is a commendable step to brdge this gap. There ae people who are criticising tis step but they are thinking of the short term, problems that they are facing and not thinking of the long term solutions to the deep routed problems of the society.so, as it is said excess of everything is bad, lets cut down the wealth that had been stored in our homes as black money because it is a solution to the increasing gap that is plaguing our society.",2.5

The reasons are fairly obvious, there are government schemes and aids for poor people but it never reaches them, their benefits are again enjoyed by few rich people. Schemes like gas subsidy are launched but due to wrong practices these subsidies are never availed by truly poor people. The rich try to stay rich by following malpractices. Moreover the poor are also not aware of the available government schemes and aids as it does not reach them. Mutual benefit is a term not forseen by both classes. There can be concequences to such practices, like if the poorer portion of the society keep growing poor they can not sustain with growing market prices and ultimately it will reduce the unskilled labour population which can effect the industry altogether. The wealth earned by rich is through the work of these lower working class people and their welfare needs to be looked after. Ultimately the country can only progree with mutual growth of every citizen but not just the rich or the poor.Ultimately we all being human we must progress together.Remedy for such a problem can be scrutiny from the government to keep check on their schemes and aidsfor the poor and to see that it actually reaches them. Awareness should be the main objective. Amount of taxes and monetary benefits should be based on financial strength of each individual. It is understood that this emerging problem would require time to be kept in check, still these points could reduce this gap to some extent and further it will be our duty as a citizen to assist the government in their plans and not simply criticize.",3.5

400,2,2_154,"The huge gap between rich and poor, globally and within nations, is not only morally wrong; it is also a source of practical problems.- Dalai Lama.Economic inequality consists of disparitis in the distribution of wealth, accumulated assets and income. Economic inequality has been there throughout the globe, since decades. The reasons for economic inequality are often interrelated. The few reasons for economic inequality are:1. Inequality in wages and salaries. 2. Technological changes. 3. Policy reforms.4. Taxation5. Globalization.A major cause of economic inequality is the determination of wages, in a capitalist market. Wages are determined by supply and demand. Higher the demand, a limited supply, wages rises and vice versa. As a result there is a growing gap between wages. Technological changes, starts to make man power look obsolete. Lot of people have lost jobs owing to technological changes. Policy reforms need to be more effective and must be implemented properly. Progressive taxation needs to be implemented and tax slabs needs to be increased. There must be relief for the poor and better social schemes. The result of all these causes the gap to widen between the rich and poor.A perfect example to showcase the gap between rich and the poor is the city of Mumbai. The financial capital of India is the home to Asia&#039;s largest slum: Dharavi. How can it be even possible, Financial capital and Asia&#039;s largest slum at one place? The reason being economic inequality. As a result of this growing economic inequality, half of earth&#039;s wealth lies in the hands of one percent of its people while a quarter of population cannot feed itself a day&#039;s meal. An effective remedy for this problem would be as follows:1. More social schemes with effective implementation.2. Equity must be ensured and not equality. 3. Everyone must get access to equal opportunities. 4. Globalization resulting in more employment opportunities for the unemployed and the BPL.5. Proper redressal forum and mechanisms to be heard.6. Active participation of Government. With political stablity and active management and control, a lot can be achieved. Cutting branches and leaves wont stop a tree from growing, unless it is uprooted.

403,2,2_229,"One of the alarming problems in the society today is the ferociously increasing gap between the rich and poor. This problem of the vast difference in the status of rich and poor existed even in older times and has been in the society eversince. Even though there have been efforts to curb it down, most them have been futile due to the kind of business market and corporate world that exists.The reason for this, I guess, is money being the source and aim of everything and everyone. If you need or want to do anything, you need to have money. And if you do something, you do it to earn money. This straightaway points to the fact that a person with more money is exposed to more opportunities and has a lot higher chances of becoming successful, which is also judged by the amount of money he has, than a person with very less bank balance whose whole lifetime is limited to certain daily deeds. Infact most of them don&#039;t even have a bank account.

Charity is also one of the solution for this problem. Some rich people do provide food and other things to poor. Here we can put a thought of regenerative income.

The job wages are determined by the demand and supply in capitalist market. Apart from these market related factors affecting the gap between the rich and the poor, we have several other factors that lead to increase this gap. government facilitated initiatives also affect the gap.Implementation of progressive taxation that will result in rich being taxed relatively more as compared to the poor: hence the amount of income inequality can be reduced. Minimum wage legislation initiative will raise the income of the poorest workers. Product subsidization initiative will result to services and goods being provided cheaply to everybody.In conclusion for rich become the rich and the poor become more poor can be resolved by putting efforts on financial literacy,education, investment in human capital but all this is not exected to happen in just one day or the other but will take time with the efforts of everyone.",3.5

Mostly Rich people are involved in politics and that's why they do not have to face any legal case and who files a legal action against them, they handles all these matters with their money and bought the officers and all other persons who can be a hindrance between them and their money. Poor people are also irresponsible because most of them do not save money for their future and spend almost all money what they earn in a day. Lack of education is also a case which is creating an imbalance in thye gap between poor and riches. Lack of technology and education closed many doors for the poor ones to earn money. They only believe in hard work, they not try to earn more money with less work ie. they are not familiar with the efficient work to earn money. Poor people are also have lack of economic management skills that's why they are not capable to save their monry in efficient way.

It is obvious that the lower caste like SC/ST or may be OBC are poor at the time when government has not provided relaxation. But now a days it is very good that they have got ralaxation by the government.Now we talk straight about the relation between rich and poor people. Specially in densly populated regions the poverty are at high rate . And due to poverty the illitraticy rate is high. Poor people can't able to get proper education,due to which they go back and back every day, and somewhat rich people get higher education anhd hold the higher position and higher rank. Due to which they get to achieve attitude with them.And they start partilities between the rich and poor people.And it is truth that from ancient time their are traind of making rich people more richer and poor people to the poorest one. And now a days in modern period also this trend is continued .e.g, In ancient period all people have to pay the taxes to the ruling govt. (king) but king goes to increase the tax every month, and the people who unable to pay the tax they got the sevier punishment. same condition repeat now a days govt. use to make the tax high day by day which are unable to pay by the poor people.Just we can talk about the nation among which some of the nations are poor and some of the nations are rich. due to some previous attacks on some nation like japan ,France,Italy, etc they become poor at that time . And at that instant no other nations goes to help them beacuse they became poor at that time . Bu8t right now they have developed a lot by themselves.And they goes to help other nation. And now they also became a powerful nations.Hence the conclusion says that no partilities should be done between the -poor and rich people.

With the current economy and the modern development, this gap is increasing as the rich is getting richer and the poor is getting more poorer.Various reasons can be presented forward to the following issue. All the schemes and policies made by the government, which focuses on the enrichment and welfare of the poor, are having adverse effects. The ones who are sitting at the top level of managements and at the position of responsibilties are the one who are getting beneffited. The main reason behind this rucuss is that the upper governing body is doing a lot of efforts for the welfare of the poor but the problem lies behind the middle working body who works under the governing body and are responsible for joining the common people to the central body. These are ones who are making all the money out of the various beneficiary schemes put forth by the government.The solution to such problems are available, but need to lay efforts to bring them into the action. a small governing body should be made who should be only answerable to the central body, no other workforce or systems , as to bring the various problems and issues of the poor one and of those who are in need. The government should also have a regulatary check measures on the income and earnings of the rich. Also various fundraising events should be organised for the development and growth of poor people. Also, the government should bring forward an additional tax to get money for development of poor from those who are big entrepreneurs or bussiness tycoons, having a high anual profit. several initiatives should be put forth like  mann ki awaz by PM narendra modi, which sets a direct connection of the central body to common people as to listen there issues and problems and trying to work upon them.Thus one should be humble and generous enough to look forward towards the one who are not living a life of general standing , i.e., clothing shelter and two meals of the day and also should encourage others to look after the other to save the humanity.",3.5

Typically the term, the gap between the poor and the rich refers to inequality among groups and individuals in the society, but can as well refer to inequality among countries. The gap between rich and poor is related in terms of equity, opportunity equality and outcome equality.There are several reasons for growing gap in the society of rich and poor. These reasons normally are interrelated. The major factors that are seen to affact the growing gap include culture, education, globalization, policy, taxes reforms and the inequality salary and wages. A major cause of growing gap is the wage determinations of capitalist market. For instance where we see that in case of job the labor is more than the total jobs for a desirable time. When the supply is high and the demand is low for the job that is call low wage. Apart from this kind of facts there are other kind of facts like government facilities. Incase of education system that difference is more. In government school we see that the there is no school fees but incase of private school we see that they required money for the teaching purpose that is why the many of poor family boy cannot study that type of school where study environment is good.In conclusion I want to say that the rich become rich and poor become more poor that difference can be minimized by financial, education, investing in the human capital.

These crimes are born out of hatred and rage when people are deprived of their rights which the government have allocated them. The government has provided land and food at low cost for the poor but some real life jackals think that they can get filthy rich by acquiring these lands. Thus they somehow manage to take away the alloted lands secretly by hook or by crook for these people and sell them at very rate to the rich people. Thus this whole process is giving rise to rage out of which crimes are born.Mostly, the reason behind this plaque is corruption. Acommonperson has to go through various feedings for getting a job done in a government organisation. This is not only unethical bt also a severe cause of poverty as due to the bribings going on may be the person is left nothing after all that. As a result the societyis plaguing termendously giving rise to murders and other crimes. Other reasons include dishonesty and unfair means and a lot of other aspects which play a crucial role in the plaguing.Thus for that quarter population to feed a day's meal we have to stop corruption and be honest in our work. We have to treat others as humans and give them their rights for food and shelter by making compromises from the rich and making them pay for the development for our and enrichment of our society.",3.0

Most of the people is now in india is failingto feed them self.Some of the community in india is still far away from education food and a good life. On the other hand other people are living a luxarious life. They feed their children good food and sent them to a good school. So, we have such a disbalanced situation.It has many diffrent ways to overcome it.

There are some policies like work for every one, education for every children, helth centrre for poors.Some of the good steps in our country is taken by our government to distribute the welth to everyone. We need to do this kind of work in every sector. Not only government, it needs people like us, who are educated and young to help the government to fullfill their target. Some steps which i think will be help full is discussed below:First of all we need to educate the child of our country, they will be our future asset, we need to spend money there first. Secondly, we have to create an enviournment where the from a child can come to school, and that is job for the parents. This two main reason for welth is not distirbuing in our country. We have to focus on small industry where the those people who are not much educated. Then two work will be done. good earning will surely ensure good enviournment for children for education. The third thing which we need to focus on that is that is the look after the rich people who are earning more money than their income in a dishonest way. Thisd kind of problem is very serious in india. We need to taken care of all this.One thing is to remember is that tomake a big change we need a collective effort.

Major part of income generation is mostly inhands of rich people so it increases their chances to become more rich and looses the hopes of poor people. Its not that poor people arent working or not intrested in working bt still they mostly remains unemployed by any of the reason and this increases gap betwwen poor and rich.somtimes we found that rich exploits the rights of poor by dominating rulling power on them.The major problem poorer is facing is not having source of income. They dont get opportunity to fullfill their basic needs. Sometimes rich uses his power and expolits poor.staticts shows that worlds wealthiest countries have 13% of worlds population but 45% of its purchasing power ; the poorest nations have 42% poplulation bt 16% of its purchasing power. It is important to help poor ones to get right source of income so that they can improve their standard of living.Govt has toinitiate several employments programmes to aware people about new jobs and opportunites. only then gap can be covered.",3.0

468,2,2_276,"It is absolutely true that the whole wealth of earth is not equally distributed in average, among all the people. Some are very rich while some are extremely poor. This has created two different sections of the society. Some stay in lareg buildings and beside that building, exist the area of slums.Some are sending their child to foreign for getting good education while some sleeps besidesthe railway tracks. Some have lunch and dinner regularly at five star hotels while some do not get meal two times a day. Government has made many rules and have passed many acts but those are not followed in strict ways. That money is also taken by the people who are not supposed to take in corrupted ways.Another reason is theblack money that is held by some people.Also, some people like the the celebrities are earning extremely large amount of money while some like the farmers are earning extremely low. One remedy can be the step that has been taken by the government recently i.e, depositing the 500 and 1000 rupee notes in bank. This is a very good step taken by our government because black money is mainly stored in the form of these notes. So,a largeamount of illegal money is going to be reduced that may reduce this gap to a little extent.Also, I think that income tax of people who are earning more than 10 lakhs a year should be increased and at the same time the indirect taxes should be reduced which is creating a struggling factor for the poor for buying the primarygoods in the market.

Poor people are working full day for their one meal and the one percent wealthier pepole are getting their work done by using black money. Even the laws that are made in favour of the poor people , they are not aware of it because of the less amount of education provided to them.This further is increasing the black money instead in the houses of the richer people and decreasing the conditions of the poor people.An effective remedy to this problem would be first providing poor people with the appropriate amount of knowledge so that nobody could cheat on them. The poor people should be provided with free education institutes which can increase their ways to earn for their living. various different organisations should be made so that they can help poor people in making them learn about all the digital solutions provided now.The poor people even are not provided with the correct wages which was meant to be given to them according to the gorvenment.

While the remaining quarter of the population cannot find daily bread to feed them and their family.Today it is a scenerio that the poors are getting poorer and the richs people are getting richer. This could be the due because the governments don't have the specfic plans for the future. Now a days it is the situation that rich people are funding the governments to manipulate the prevailings rules for their own business benefits.Consider an analogy related to the most richest brothers in india:The Ambani brothers.

This is the scenerio which leads to corruption and this certainly has to bear by the people in the country in the form of taxes.Lack of proper planning by the government could be one of the issue related to the above problems. Government should form the general laws for each and every people and this laws should be same for every respect of people.This could be well understand by forming the laws for the below poverty people and giving them houses so that atleast they can have their houses to dwell.

In the poor family the family head is often unable to fed there children properly and they can not give their children prper educatin even many of the poor children can not go to school for lack of money.We should think what is the reason behind this unequallity. If one notice our society deeply they can find that the rich peoples often prefer to ignore the poor or economically backward persons and refused to give them opportunuity. Like if one poor go to bank and apply for loan to start abusiness the authority generally ignore his application give the loans to someone who has a wellknown person as referense. As a result the poor can not grow economically though he has the talent. Thus the poor community peoples are always avoided by the rich community and they remain in backword position.We have to think about the solution of this very dissapointing matter. The first step we can do for their improvement is to educate them. Education can give them opportunity to lead agood life.Now a days it is often seen that government has open many free vocational training cources that the youth from poor families can take and may get an opportunty to get a job or can start their own business.Is is obviously a good step from government.

The issue of economic inequality is related to the ideas of equity i.e. eqality of outcome and equality of opportunity. Out of many reasons for economic inequality within our society, most prominent of them can be stated as : the income gap between skilled and non skilled workers, concentration of wealth in hands of fewer individuals, labour markets, globalization, policy reforms, taxes, education, technological changes etc. .We can see most of causes can be inter-related.  A major cause of this gap within our society can be stated as determination of wages by the capitalist market, which are set on principleof supply and demand. The number of workers willing to do a job. Unless other forces intervene, an overabundace of labour will tend to drive down its price, which naturally means that workers and their families will have less to live on.Falling wasges isn&#039;t the only  reason why labour oversupply leads to ineaquality, as the slice of economic pie to the employees diminishes, the share going to employers goes up.Apart from market-driven factore that affect wage inequality, government sponsored initiatives can also increase or decrease inequality. Social scientists and policy makers debate the relative merits and effectiveness of each approach to regulating inequality. Typical government initiatives to reduce economic inequality includes :a) Public education : Increasing the supplu of skilled labor and reducing income inequality due to education differentials.b) Progressive taxation : The rich are taxed proportionally more than the poor, reducing the amount of income inequality in soci",3.5

508,2,2_151,"The increasing gap between rich amd poor is plaguing our society, this statement is somehow true, because in this world rich becomes richer and poop gets poorer. Poors are trying to become rich by doing hard work or by doing any other possible things but in the end, half or more than half of their wages will go to rich person. And in other point of view rich also have black money, poor even do not have money to eat, how can they manage to get black money. They pay full tax in every thing. The major reason behind the increasing gap between rich nad poor is somewhat theft of money from government by not giving them tax, storing money in their accounts or in their house without showing the records to the government, this reason is majorly responsible to make the rich more richer and due to this effect the prices of goods and services become more, which adversely effect the growth of poor, and poor remain poor. According to survey, Government of many countries found that half of earth's wealth lies in the hands of one percent of its people while a quarter of the population cannot itself a day's meal. In my opinion the new idea of changing the currency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be very helpful to minimize the gap between rich and poor in the country. People with black money have to show their money to the income tax department and 60% of the total amount will go to income tax office in the form of tax and further go to Government of India, to make India better. And after sometime this blackmoney will to poor as a boomerang and will help poor to complete their desires and even to fill their empty stomach. And this will change the position of the country.",2.5

Their are many other problems like wealth concentration in the hand if a few individuals or institutions. The major cause of this inequality within modern economies is the determination of wages for jobs are set by supply and demand.Thier are many problems like globalization, technology cahnges, policy reforms, taxes, education, racism, gender, culture which has become main problem of this type of inequality.If there is low supply and high demand, it will result in the high wages.The gap in wages produces inequality between different types of workers.Government initiatives for reducing the economic inequality is being taken as public education which will increase the supply of skilled labor and reducing income inequality due to education differntial, progressive taxation, minimum wage ligislation that will raise the income of the poorest workers.

533,2,2_332,"In my views there is no doubt in saying that people who are rich are always treating poor people as their servant which is the cause of gap between rich and poor people. There are many rich people who are having three times meal in a day on the other hand there are many people who cannot even feed themselves and their family members. There are many rich people who are always worried about thier lifestyle and personality. Some of the rich people always wants to show other that they are rich.I think the cause of this gap is that there are not more works for poor people by which they can earn money and fulfill their basic needs. For Example - Labour who earn only 300 or 400 rupees per day have to spend their life by this money only. And this money is also not fixed, when there is no work they have to sit at home doing nothing.The effective solution which our government should implement is that more and more work should be created for people who are in need of work. There are many people who are talented but they didnot get a chance to explore themselves. The platform should be provided to these type of people so that they can implement their skills for upliftment and benefit of country. For example - We should create more and more things and for creating more things it would require more industrialisation thus it will create jobs for needy people.And also there are many poor people who can not take education so education should be provided to these types of people. The people who are in village should be provided education by the means of literacy programs. These literacy programs can be done by college students.And also rich people can also come forward to support poor and needy people.",3.0

They dont even enjoy basic neccities of life of food,water,shelter which on other hand rich people enjoy very much, having lavish lifestyle, fancy clothing, expensive cars and other stuffs.In order to curb more and unwanted expenditure by rich people government has imposed tax laws and to provide poor people with basic needs many schemes are being implemented like FOOD FOR WORK PROGRAMME which provide food to people who are working as laborers, MGNREGA which provide guarantee employment to unemployeds so that they can earn their living themselves. Also Self Help Groups for women and children are made to increase women employment and stop child labour as children who are under 14 years had to work to earn a living for their families and many more such schemes have been launched by government to stop this widening gap between rich and poor section of society.So, if all join hands together this problem of poverty, hunger and backwardeness of society can be solved easily and then India could alsdo be in the lead in comparison to ther developed nations of the world.MOVING INCH BY INCH TOWARDS DEVELOPMENT.",3.5

Economic inequality refers to the inequality among individuals and groups within a society. Inequality is most often measured, a static used to demonstrate the dispersion of wealth in agroup. The gap between the rich and poor can be illustrated by the fact that the three wealthiest individuals in the world have assets that exceed those of the poorest 10 percent of the world's population. The fact inequality exists between nations is seen in the statistics that the world's wealthiest countries have just 13 percentof the world's population but 45 percentof its purchasing power.The poorest nations have 42 percentof the world's population and 9 percentof its purchasing power.                            In the United states,the decline of manufacturing and subsequent high rates of unemployment among unskilled laborers illustrates the impact of market forces on inequality.

These have become the major causes of the widening gap between rich and poor. Because of these, poor people are becoming poorer and the rich are becoming richer. Poor people who account for about a quarter of the population of the country are not able to feed themselves a day's meal.

Our government can provide free education to the poor people by employing teachers for a rural area itself so there will be a very little conflict of momey interest.

But in these cases also the people of these castes who are economically stronger are benefitted more. These reservation policy also does not help the poor people much. These people most of the times do not even know the policies formed for them and are unable to get the benefits. Rich people are not at all concerned about the weaker section as they are busy earning more and more money and in making their life much more comfortable and luxurious.The weaker section of the society can be benefitted if the are aware of the schemes and policies made for the, so government must look in detail that these people much made aware about all the policies working in their favour. The reservation or quota must be given on the economic backgroung of the person and not the caste to which a person belongs.

Because of this seventy percent of total population work for thirty percent of population. All poor people not get the benefits of all the provided materials from the governments. And because of this all the wealth of todays world lies in hands of one percent of population. due to these reasons our society, still needs people interfearence, so that we make them more knowledgeble so that they move with rich people in every field of the world.There can be some effective remedy for this , government can talk with poor people directly so that govt. understand their problems and take steps to solve these problems so that poor people can also enjoy the freedom, govt. also announce the latest implementation of rules for poor people on radio and on television.We should give them knowledge of our constitution, and tell them about our rights so that they raise questions, and complain their problem directly to government. Government must provide education for older age people also so that they do their small business successfully in market and earn good profit. so that they see dream and do's their best to make their dreams truth, so that they move equally with rich people. we taught poor people how to think differently to become different.",2.5

578,2,2_40,"We must actually appreciate the guy who coined the name RICH and POOR. Abbreviations for those terms have been moving through the social media over decades stating that rich will become richer whereas poor will become poorer. Yes it definitely causes a lot of descrimination leading to social problems. There are a lot of reasons for this gap between rich and poor which is climbing up at a higher rate in underdeveloped country like ours. Once we were told that our country was a developing economy until sometime 3 months before, a economic statistics firm told that were are an underdeveloped economic stated country. That hurt a lot of youngsters incluing me. The reasons behind this increasing gap between rich and poor are primarily due to political tactics. Recently we would have heard the news that UttarPradesh chief minister Akilesh Yadav had personal affairs with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav for the past few weeks. Suddenly they were united under Lalu Prasad Yadav. What infers from this news is that,in order to get majority of votes in the coming election and to remain in power, even those guys hide their personal emotions. People who live beyond their income level to succesfully run a family won&#039;t have time to notice these problems existing in the country. If a promise is given of providing any free products, or subsidies or discounts, they will vote for that political party. Behind the scene is what they fail to notice. Those so called leaders will collect a lot of cash which is sanctioned by central or state government to perform people friendly tasks such as laying roads, street light, etc which they won&#039;t do. Instead they will grow richer and we normal people will never grow up.Half of wealth lies truely in the hands of one percent of the people. Some of those people would have done hard work (Elon Musk-Tesla) where else some would have done smart work (Mark Zuckerberg- Facebook) and few with fraud works (you know them). On the other side nearly 30% of the people don&#039;t have shelter nor feed themselves a meal once a day. Some urge the removal of 500 and 1000 rupee notes in our country, reason behind it is to find the black money. It is by far the best remedy. Nothing else can bypass smart work.",2.5

581,2,2_181,"The gap between rich and poor is increasing day by day on a large basis.The reason being the improper division of wealth in the hands of the poor.It has been in due to the political influence of the parties in the government system.The whole distorted government system leads to improper wealth division.The political parties get fund from the rich people which in return as a mark of favour give enormous tenders,business approvals which act as a beneficiary for them to raise profitmargins in their buisness.The government on the other hand allow the wealthy people to do corrupt activites,illegal activties which directly affect their consumers health and wealth.Because of which the consumers get unhealthy and buy more medicines and thus onlywealthy people get more wealthy in the pharmaceuticals sector.Simulataneously the government approves illegal mines which deterioate the health of the labour class because just for the sake of the money they get indulged in this illegal activity but since it is illegal activity they get a very less amount because of which they remain poorer as chances of their money increment does't increase.The poor class so does't have the right to these favours and thus giving the government the situation to let the wealthy utilise it for their advantage.Hence it can been seen that the poor are suffering the most because of which the rich are supressing them.So, the authorityshould take into accounnt the reason why the poor are suffering and thus find out ways to rectify the solutions for the benefits of the poor.The rich should leave their selfishness and think about the poor and hence then only our society and can be equalized and so the main concern of the humanity that is equality for all will be achieved and hence this should be the solution.",2.5

Rich people are becoming more rich while the poors are getting more poorer. They have been narrowed down tosmall streets while the rich rests in theirporshbunglows.The basic reason of this problem is lack of education. Due to this lack of education there is an insecurity which persistin various peoplemind. This insecurity holds them back from developing.

Promoting beggers to set up small scales business and showing them the path towards better future is a way, in this way they wont be reduced to begging but will spread across nation and would atleast be able to mange a day's mean.

583,2,2_16,"Yes, it is true that the gap between rich and poor is increasing day by day. The main reason for that is the corruption. The people who are rich, maximum of them are corrupted. They blind taxes, that cause a economic damage in a country. If we in a whole we can see that all contries are not rich. Countries from African continent are much poor than the contries from Europe and Amarica. The main reason for that is the power. Countries in europe and USA has more power, so they dominate the world. And they are situated in such a place where the avilability of raw materials to grow an industry is enough. Not only that they have the climate to grow sufficient food for their country. But for the African countries those opportunities are not avilable. So they badly depend on the rich countries. If we talk about power then those countries who have more arms has more power. Like USA attacked Iraq and they dominet the oil fields of the UAE. Is this cause all people in UAE to become rich? NO, By this the USA becomes rich as they have the ownership over those oilfields. Now if we talk about our country then there are so many causes to increasing gap between rich and poor. Those are, i)The reservation system, this is one of the main cause in india. Because this system is based on the casting system not on the basis of income. So who donot need money, they getmore and who those need money, they get nothing. 2)Large population of India. As India is thesecond most populated country in the World so it is not possible that everybody will become rich. For this reason here the competetion of becoming a rich person is very high. 3)Corruption. We can see in the news chanels that most of the ministers and rich people are corrupted. So they are becoming more rich and poor are geeting more poor. Someof those corruption examples are 2G spectrum scam, Vijay Mallya froding bank, Ringing Bell scam, etc. So if we want to build a world where no one is poor then we have to get an economy system where everyone gets equal money for their particular jobs.",5.0

Few are so reach that no one know about their ecact status walth and prpperty and other are dying becouse of starvation.This contradictory situartion is due to the gap between the rich and the poor of this world.Only one percent of the earth's population is holding half of the whole wealth and half of them are wandering jobless, what?. No matter, how wierd it may sound but it is the horrible truth of today's world.Now,let us gradually jump to the real few reasns behind this situation.The reasons are many, from political to economiacal, from global to localand many more.These reason contribute to making of rich more richer and poor more poorer. First of all, the rich will and have access to all the reasourcwes existing int he world. so, there is no limit or restriction to them. But when we co0me to poors or middle class people, the can never access all the resopurces the want whwn neede3d because they cannot buy all of them.That is why the are called poor!.As we prpperly examine the hierarchy of the society based on the money and wealth, the condition gets worst as we move down.The quarter of the earth's population cannot even feed itself a day of meal prperly. So, the question about the basic education and health sounds really absurd here. This is the real reason behind the malnutrition and lack of the education worldwide.Becuse, you need food first! and every thing comes thereafter.We all desire of being reach and wealthy and we all curse all tyhe rich people out there for our real condition. But, what is the real way or the magical solution to overcome this gap?.The answer is as complex as the problem it self is.Ofcourse, we cannot stop rich from earning but the goverment should take a note of there income and it sources, like the blackmoney type of things. On the other side, we need to ecourage every type of business and jobs which will increase the selfdependence and income of the jobless and poor.At the end, we can say that while the problem is as old as it is big ,it have been existing probably whith the starting of the era of trade and economy culture few thousand years ago.But withh proper idea and plans we can overcome or get rid of it at slow pace. Employment plolicies, loan schemes and quotas can be considerd as solution for the problem",4.0
585,2,2_199,"Standing in the tweenty-first century it has been rightly said, the rich is getting richer and the poor is getting poorer. India gained its independence in 1947 and since then many a thing has improved for the good while some remained stangant and possible have turned worse, the gap between the rich and the poor is one such glaring example. We have all been into 5-star restaurants and hotels, to bars and pubs, have we ever for a moment thought, have they, the person who are the root reason for our food, eaten their daily meal while we are munching onto our delicacies. Have we ever thought has the child of the rickshaw puller who brought us at our home, sweating his heart out, eaten his dinner? Have we ever thought why our maid-servant took off from duty for a few days? The answer is loud and clear. Its is NO. If we had ever taken or take a moment out of our life to think of them, probably we would have been right up in the list of developed countries i nthe world.The government of a country is as good as its people are. Little is still done to electrify the remote villages where our farmers stay. Little is done to improve the irrigation system. Little is done to facilitate transport of their commodities to the cities. Yes we do forget that they too have a family and they too have to eat to work. Money is spent on movie promotions, on sports promotions, on election campaigns, on sports persons, on building expensive hotels after hotels and what not. Does our society really need it? Are we just to the people, who are our primary cause of survival. I certainly don&#039;t think so. We are blessed with money, to eke out our survival but where is equality? Is it not our responsibility to look after them, much like they are looking after us? We are irresponsible in that sense I must say. In a team, when one player does bad, the other is there to compensate for it, the result is a victory but where is this compensation in out society? Is the money we have entirely for ourselves and not meant to be provided to others, who really don&#039;t have even the smallest fragment of what we have. Its when we will compensate for this poverty amongst the poor, will be become a top nation and will really deserve to feel proud being a cosmopolite. We don&#039;t need a 50K smart phone to meet our daily needs, we can manage with a 10K one, we can share the rest 40K amongst those who may never even know what a phone is. The happiness gained in doing such a deed, is indeed an acheivement. Smile is the most precious gift. Alas! I live in a society which knows little about gifting it.I may say it once more as many of them have done but I don&#039;t think a page of essay will change the upcoming days. The poor will still live believing that they are the cursed lot. They won&#039;t get food, medicine, health-care, home and every little thing they crave for. The poor boy of 5 years will still need to beg in the railway station when I will come back home from college, as he has for the past 1 year I have seen.

589,2,2_390,"Accordind to Marxist perspective, the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer (ouch! right?). It is is vicious circle true in all its dimensions. There are only a few lucky ones who make their way out of misery due to sheer determination and well the odds favoring him.          The basic reason behind such condition is the acess to education. The rich are capable or acqiring the educational facilities available to them. The also reach out to higher education. It is truly believed that Success requires learning and knowledge, which is unfortunately only available to the richer class people. Poor people priortize their need, that is, food, which also requires money though but that can be received in cheaper amounts too. Sometimes the poor are deprived of basic needs like shelter, food, and clothing too. So their major aim is not sucess or getting richer but getting the physiological needs to be fulfilled first. For this is engage in occupations that suffice only their basic needs whereas richer people usually enage in the occupations that get them to become even more richer. Another reason for th gap between the rich and the poor getting wider or even existing in the first place is that the poor are conditioned to been dominatied or supressed by the upper class. Thus, they naturally believe that their job is only yo pay service to the richer upper class and get paid by them. The upper class on the other hand, due to healthy conditions prevailing in their environments are more career oriented and strive to exand their status and wealth. This conditions have their roots since the begining time, sadly. It leads to a lot of psychologically problems. Not saying the poor turn crazy. Just saying it leads to depression, agressions (plus all sorts of other ssions!&#039;). They usually deviate to criminal endeavors to acquire or fulfil their basic needs. Our society is too blind to dig the roots of criminal activities. But at the heart, no one is born as a bad person, situations and conditions make them do bad things or choose the bad roads. Seeing your own kid straving to death is a major deriving foce to anybody for ending his hunger by any means possible, isn&#039;t it? As we talk about the measures, there are plenty, but is the society really willing to take that road. I mean who doesn&#039;t enjoy superiority over the supressed or even your younger brother for that matters?. The only way of ending this up is the Baba Sahebs way. The poor has to wake up themselves and realise the power they behold and manifest it until a new morning to them. Education plays a vital role in awakening, which can be provided to them. Love, care, support and oh yes Employment can also play a vital role in ending this gap. This Gaps quite possible might never end (trust me! I am a pessimist). But it an be shortened for sure if people as a mass really determine to work towards it. Basically, All men are equal this saying should be put to force.

The invention of telephone, computersthat has become a need and is very kind of helping hand which is more advancing now a days also has some darker sides which includes many illegal works such as hacking, terrorism activity etc and another drawback is it is affecting the new generation so much that they are not thinking anything creative or have any wish to do something innovative.Thus, we can see that technology has a very bright as well as very dark side, it is very much relative to comment whether a technology is our master or slave, as it is completely depends upon person to person. Personaly i disagree that we are becoming slaves to our own creation as i see this creation as my companion which will always enlighten us.

Today, people are becoming enslaved to their own creation. Technology was invented by human. it was invented to make our lives easier. And truly it had played its part. But like it is said too much of anything makes it a addiction.These days everyone is addicted to technology.Whether it is facebook, whatsapp,instagram etcectra etcectra.We have begun to blend our personal and professional life. People have more friends on social media whereas truthfully speaking they hardly have any real friends. Technology was supposed to help us in making our lives easier but we have given it the ultimate power : to control us .It is very important to understand that this is suicidal deal. We ourselves are making our lives more complicated and difficult by excessively using technology. Significantly, we putting our own health at risk by enjoying the comforts provided by technology. We cannot even go a second without technology. Everyone has become so submissive to technology that it is more important to check our mobile phone constantly instead of focusing on the person sitting in front of us. We have long forgotten the real pleasure of seeing someone smile with their eyes shining brightly instead our life is filled with photoshoped moments of one&#039;s life.We are using technology to impress others rather than expressing ourselves. If this goes on then we will hardly see anyone talking on streets as it is more important to chat on facebook.Thus stop relying on technology. It can  help the qualified,well trained human being, but cannot replace them.Technology is besty when it briungs people closer",3.5

We all are somehow binded by the modern instrumentation surrounding us. From morning's Facebook Login to night's whatsapp chat, we somehow pass our day. In this 21st century where no human wants to wake up early and go for a morning walk out there but rather stay late till night on modern gadgets we surely know that there is something wrong. Blaming only the technology won't make any right instead of that it should be our responsiblity to makeup for all our losses. Since an old saying says Everythings posses an advantage and disadvantage, use of technology too works on this principle. It effects our day to day life, rather than using the word 'effect' i would say 'helps' as it saves our ample amount of times and labour work. But ultimately this habit of using technology due to it's shortcut is the ultimate reason we as a humans are turning out lazy and more disease prone ( commonly heart problems ). y",3.5

Actually, we are using technology to a large extent in daily life to make it easy as well as to increase productivity,however,it is often misinterpreted as an addiction due to differences in perception of optimistic and pessimistic people.We should look towards the brighter phase of coin and should increase the awareness among people to make use of technology.

We should not completely depend on technology as it effect our personal life.

The reason is well known, the addiction towards it and creating devastating effects on human minds. And the part of society which has the great impact of technology is the youth of the nation. The growing children are much attracted towards the mobile games, and more habitual to computers, television, etc., which is creating a destructive impact on their developing minds. And this is really a worrying condition for the society as the technology has made the human addicted to it.As every coin has two faces and likewise this creation of human i.e. technological science has its own face. The human creation for the ease of every little work, to be more and more advanced has made the creators his own slave. The increasing advancement in technologies day to day has made our life very easier as well as very complicated. It had made us to do all possible things right clicking at a single button from our laptops, mobiles, etc. We don't have to think a second more for connecting to our abroad relatives, friends which has made our tasks more comfortable. But these advantages had also led to different stressful causes.Likewise taking examples of the social networking sites facebook, whatsapp, other chat messengers, the people are spending most of their time surfing on internet which effects them simultaneously affecting their eyes, minds, making them stressful, etc. And the young childrens from the age 2 years are aware of mostly each functions of mobile phones which shows that from that age only they are so attracted to the technological science. The new applications are being created day by day to make our work easier like applications for net banking, travelling, video calling, etc. which are very useful but making human more lazy and making them less social.Hence the rate of health degradation is inclining day by day causing different health issues like heart problems, diabetes, obesity which is reducing the age of the human life. The technolgy is made for the betterment of society but one should have control on the use of it otherwise that will be more disastrous to human society.One should try to not to make this attracting science an addiction.",4.0

Some could call technology the 8th sin while others could hail it&#039;s might and treat it has a harbinger of all things good and pure. On one hand, technology has improved the standards of living and made things which could only be only imagined and if ever someone talked about such ideas of flying or talking to someone across the seven oceans immediately then the people around them would label he/she &#039;crazy&#039; or &#039;mentally retarded&#039;.

The use of technology has influenced a huge growth and development in the society. Almost every sections of the society has been run by technology. Science has been a major factor which has contributed to the advancement of todays tech savy world. Due to this rampant usage of tech in every sphere of life, we have become addicted to our own creation.The youth of our generation especially are vastly affected as they are now inside thier homes and busy in computer, video games, t.v gadgets etc. This in turn has reduced their participation in the outside world and therefore they are reluctant to indulge in outside activities. This reduces their real life experience and thus impacts on their thoughts which ultimately hampers their chances to grow in this competetive environment.Though technology has become a great success in one hand but on the other hand it has also affected the people to think on their own rather than depending on the technology. In earlier days people didn't have access to technology but still major inventions were discovered at the earlier stages of human existence. Therefore, I believe, that yes we have become addicted to technology and are slaves to our own creation. Rise in use of technology has also led to the rise in laziness in the people of our generation which affects the personality and also its contribution to the society.

Life is fast paced , &amp; technology makes things simpler .Its a beleif that has penetrated the youngest of minds. Gone are those days when a 10 year old kid was addicted to the play ground and lived through the pages of books. Now , the 10 year old has plans of living summers through gaming on the PS3 &amp; winters researching on Google &amp; Youtube for his/he upcoming school project. Technology has spread its wings throughout society , at the grassroot level.Every child today owns a smart phone , let alone the adults. With technology in the form of phones, being readily &amp; cheaply available ,thanks to countrioes like China ; every one owns technology . Facebook has replaced socialising &amp; apps like whatsapp has transformed the young minds in to secretive , quiet , introverted, keeping things to themselves kind of individuals. Now i am not some one who is repelling the whole idea. But life would have been more real, had technology not made it to our  personal &amp; private gadgets. Thesedays, they say life is online. Apps being another reason to bask our thoughts upon.What is it an app cannot do?? Pretty much nothing . Starting from labour to lover , groceries to travelling , Apps can arrange it all. Which might seem like a lucrative thought , but it also means the user staying stagnant at one place &amp; letting  the app work for you. Ergo: Let Technology become Smart while you become dumb. For instance, Smart phones have made us such idiots that we don&#039;t even feel the need to remember our parents number manually , like we used to , back in the days . So if that smart phone is lost, well we are lost too. Like everything, Technology has its good &amp; bad too .

The obsession is the thought of going and getting on the computer for 14 hours a day, the compulsion is to sit and turn on the computer. The dependency of addiction is often described as using something more often than you intend to, spending a great deal of time using it, giving up important social, family, or occupational activities to use it, and thinking about reducing your use or making repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut back on the amount of time being spent using a certain technology such as the internet. These are signs of being dependent upon technology in a person's life.Working, playing, chatting, surfing on the computer and the internet has definitely become obsessive with quite a few people. Many people wonder whether there is a saturation point to this problem. Does this type of behavior qualify as a true addiction? Significant information is given identifying the real behaviors of internet addiction, such as false realities, isolation, loss of social skills and obsessive thinking; this makes it sound pretty much like an addiction does it not?

For instance,the world wide web has  barged into our lives and have started contouring the ways in which we think,speak, write,study,shop,exercise,travel,consult,share,socialise,pray,date and what not.There is no sphere in our lives which have not had the  shades of the vast technological achievements that the world is witnessing.However, it is important for us to also examine some of the flipsides of these technologies. The flipsides of the technologies necessarily translates into the flaws of the ones who use them.It is particularly pertinent for us to examine these flipsides as we have now become slaves of technology,our own creation.The first thing that most of us do in the morning after we wake up is to check our mobile phones(smartphones,iphones!) for the numerous notifications and messages on the Whatsapp. We feel strangely insecure and out of touch if we do not,now and then, unlock our phones and stare into the mobile screens and keep scrolling and typing .While we accept all that is good about the mobile phones and the whole lot of things that they help us do, it is also  vital for us to also consider how much of our personal and social lives it is making elusive for us. Many people nowadays live in the virtual worl most of the time. The reality or the real world becomes an occasional ,painful encounter. They struggle when they are asked to talk to someone on face. They react and protest on online platforms but remain passive when injustice is being done right in front of them.For anything and everything, they automatically move their hands to the phone. Nowadays the adiction to the technology has become so serious a problem for some people that they haveto consult psychiatrists and psychologists.Anything and everything in the world has two sides:a good one and a bad one.Technology is also one among them .However, whether technology ultimately becomes a good thing or a bad thing depends on who is using it. If the advanced technology goes to the right hand, it wil be great .The mode of usage is the factor that makes a thing good or bad. So it is important for us to act responsibly and sensibly when we make use of various technologies.",3.5
703,3,3_374,"From the ancient times, humans have been dependent on something or the other. From the period of early man to this day, people have been trying to find new ways to be dependent on. Every day is a day of creation, a day of innovation, a day of making life simpler. Although, technology has evovled so far for the betterment of the mankind. It has been a major profitable resource in making the world what it is today. Like every thing that exists in the universe has its pros and cons, I completey agree to the statement that we have become slaves of our own creation.From the point of time we open our eyes in the morning to the time we shut them in the night, we are surrounded by technology. The first task that we do in the morning is checking our cellphones, followed by getting ready and heading towards work. If we are travelling by trains for work, like in metropolitian cities, we need escalators to go to the platform upstairs. Same is the case when we go downstairs. We don't even try to choose the stairs, because lets face it, who is going to work so hard when we have the oppotunity to be lathargic.Some countries even have walking paths on the side of the road so that we don't have to lift our feet and walk! It was particularly made for old, sick, physically disabled people. What has happen to the world? Why we don't even feel like walking for ourselves?We need to learn that it is us who have to change the statement. Nobody else willNo one can be blamed for this but us. If we have the capability to realise that we arewrong at some point inlife, then we also have the capability to restore it.",3.5

Internet is a main part of technology. If we want to know anything about anything we can search in any search engines and can get the solutions in many ways. On the other hand nowadays many people usesit for blackmailing others by uploading their private videos whichleads tosuisides and ruins ones life.Technology also makes our life very simpler from onlineshopping toticket bookingsone can done all this work by simply sitting on thier home and no need tostand in the big lines. But nowadays technology is also proving to besomewhat bad for childrens. They all the times likes to play games, watch movies on thier mobile phones instead of going outside and play cricket or football which not only is for enjoyment but also goodfor their health. For this reasons todays children are not very physically strong thusthey uses some energy drinks to boost their nutritients.It isnot restricted to children butit affectsadults also. Most of the people are busy whole time in socialnetworking sites.I am not saying that the social networking sites are bad these are goodstheselinks us with our friends, family but we know that using something too much is not so good for us.

Is this possible that one day human workforce is going to vanish due to replacement by robots or or such new technologies? Yes, it is true that life has become much easier due to technologies. And truly speaking, we need this. Advancement in technology is needed to discover the unknown. The introduction of social networking has made our life easier. We can communicate with peoples at distant places at an ease. We dont have to spend lots of money for phone bills. Even video calling facility has made it possible to even see our close ones at distant places. We are able to discover moon, Mars and even deep space and know a lot about this universe. So science and technology is really a bless for all of us. But we are getting dependable on this technology day by day. Can you imagine a life without internet connectivity? Today softwares have taken control over big machines. We don't need humans to operate them. Thus this technology is making our life easier but the fact is that we cannot live without this technology. Actually we are becoming slaves of technology. We don't want to work hard now a days. We even want such devices to be invented that can actually read our minds are do what we want.

Waking up by alarm, scheduling their task using clock, communicating around the world through mobile phones, text messages, e-mail,video chat , ordering things online , wathing television, etc , it is all the part of the technology.Technology enables a person to do the tasks from anywhere at any time .

Now, there is no distance left between the peoples acrossthe globe.Peoples may travel thousandsof miles in hours.Technology has played an important role in the Gloablisation and Industrialisation field. At one side globalisation has made all things around the world approachable easily while industrialisation has provided the plateform for the development of the products which helps the people to live their life easily and has also provided the employement to millions of the people around the world. Technology is not only confined with computers but it also plays a great role in all the aspects of life be it a construction of roads, be it watching television, be it travelling through airways, by ship or on land, be it commnicating, be it sharing data and resources etc.Technology has provided a plateform to share data around the world . Now, it is also possible to share resources like database, RAM, computation power around the world. Internet has played an important role in the advancement of the technology. Connecting the globe cannot be imagined without internet. Internet provides us with the facility to connect with the peoples all around the world.People now are actually addicted to the technology starting from morning alarm till they sleep, communicating , doing online transaction, online shopping, sharing resources, entertainig themselves etc .

710,3,3_167,"Technology is idially supposed to be a response to human needs. this implies its primary function is to facilitate us in many simple and complicated ways. Technology is often understood in a very modern idea however its very important to point out that technology in some form has existed throughout the human existance. It would not be a exagerration to say that we are where we are because of the innovations and revisions in technology by each consecutive generation. In recent times there has been constant talks about technology increasingly becoming an addiction for the coming generations. The way gadgets have made their space in our day to day lives is indeed surreal. From shopping to preparing for an exam or a wedding, there is an app for everything. This development however is not so simple to be judged in black and white terms. While our incresed dependence on technology has indeed reduced personal connections it has also simplified life for people who  lead a very busy life. The worst effect of technology is argued to be on children, who spend most of their time hooked up to the TV or their phones. This kind of  addiction definately requires attention and needs to be dealt with on priority basis. Along with it is also argued that that technology is reducing the labour requirement for most of the works making it difficult for a heavily populated country like ours to provide employment to a very large section of its population. This argument has however recieved a lot of criticism and it has been argued that its unfair to to put the entire blame of unemployment on technology. Although its almost instinctively that one tends to aGree that technology has become a new addiction, I would like to put more faith into human intelligence and disagree with it. I agree that it is an issue that needs to be dealt with but at the same time its not a lost cause and there are already apps that aim at countering this so called addiction. Its the human nature to constantly evolve and innovate and the fact that we as a race managed to survive so much allows me to believe that we&#039;ll deal with this in time too.",4.0

Although technology may be useful in many ways, it can also be extremly dangerous and harmful to those who abuse and become addicted to it. The internet, one form of technology is perhaps the most universal form of technology. People everywhere have access to it and for the most part it is free to go onto. There are infinite things to do on internet. This includes browsing or searching, looking up gossips, reading newspapers, watching TV and movies, playing online games, social networking, and many other things. It is therefore, no wonder that the internet is so addictive. From this addictionthere many bad habbits come. Suppose as example when a student isreading for examwith attention, suddenly a whatsapp or any message from social networking sites comes then he immidiately goes for the reply. Another example in a class teacher is teaching somthing then some students on back sides are doing internet on mobiles or playing games. These are the harmfull effects of addiction. Mobile which another a big integration of technology. The day to day technologies are vastly included on it which attarcts the people of every types.

If we look after the farmers of india there work has become much easier then before.They can do farming very easily with the use of technologies and even technologiesonly are helping them to learn new way of farming.It is the technology of now a days that the village people sitting in small towns can learn new thing and can improve in many fields.It is the technology only because of which we can get food at our home I know these are some secondary factors but still they all help us a lot in our normal life.Still somewhere we know thatIndia lags in the technogy but we the new generation will touch the same height even will risemore higher than other countriesI think technology is the only thing for which everyone is ready to be a servant.I amthe slaveof technology and I can say that proudly because there are more positive points of being its slave then not.It is helping us to impove a lot in many prospectives.Technology is egalitarian every one can learn anything from it.It has given us an abridge for our life to get success.",3.5

The internet, perhaps is the most universal form of technology, people everywhere are access to it.Technology may be used in many ways like it can also be extremely dangerous and harmful to those who abuse and become addicted to it.There are infinite things to do while on the internet ,includes browsing, surfing, doing research , looking up to the latest news or gossip,watching TV and movies, playing games , etc. technology can make our life or it can ruin our life also. People who wants to actually learn something and wants to become a big man on the basis of his awareness, smartness, etc. technology is really a good thing but the people who used to of technology and access internet for just their fun it is very worst thing for their life because technology is extremely worst addictive thing for one's life.As we know every coin have two sides one positive and one negetive side, the same way technology has also two sides of it namely, good side and evil side.If we use techhnology in a good way, explore in a good manner it gives benefit to us in our lifes on the basis of employment, smartness, awareness,education and so on. But if we use technology only for the sake of our happiness we cant be success in our life. We will ruin our life by our ownselves.So, atlast i would like to conclude my point that use technology as much as you can because the century itself says that do whatever you want to do online but in a good manner not in a wrong way so that you harm yourself as well as others.",3.5

Internet addiction can keep one from doing some other productive work and skew the perception on what really matters in life or what their real priorities are. along with this spending so much time on internet can harm one's health also. the internet may be usefull but can extremely hazardous when abused.Just like internet , game addiction is a very real danger whic people face as well. Peolple forgo to sped time with their friends and family and most likely to see a fall in their grades as well. Games can cause problems like aggression as peolpe play violent games and encourage them to get voilent on things.So as a result we should not misuse technology.

Technical advancments have eased communication, connectivity, mobility, ease of doing business and many more . But has made us lost track of our personal lives. We are on the verge of being handcuffed to technology.But is there a scope of change ? Yes there is. As Pareto stated, that for achieving 100% quality one needs to get the 80% in place and 20 in queue. Same in with technology. The advancements must be in line with the people demands; but at the same time people must be given time to adapt to those changes . The best example would be our parents. The era in which they grew up, never had access to these resources . And as GenY we must take technology as a means to curb the Technical Gap rather than enlarge it .Coming to employement sector, technolgy has eased operation but is in the process of making several people jobless. Need of the hour is to train these people in their desired skills and competencies .Schemes like Make in India  ,  Skill Development or even Entrepreneurship programs must be effectively advertised to utilise the existing and raw talent. This will invariably lead to path of sustainability, effective national progress and help us internationally map our progress worldwide.The debate of technology being a boon or bane will always be indelible.

We have become slaves of technology. We have created the technology and now technologyis one of the most important reason to rise everyday.We can consider a day's work as an example. The very first thing we now do just after we wake up is checking our mobile phones. This technolgy has been providing us very useful services in daily life.

Same story for the laptops, computers, tablets etc. It is surely eliminating lot of workloads, but some how the mankind has become more like a machine, bcause of that technology.

They have caged themselves unknowingly into a certain world where natural things are not normal. We like stay at home more than outside. We like to stay silent in front of others. And these things are not normal. We have become so dependent on technology that if we cannot spent a single day without that.Though because of technology we have done so many things which acnnot be replaced but we have to admit that, we live in an era where technology has higher value than any other one.

There are so many networking sites such as facebook,Whatsapp, Snapchat,Instagram which are wasting time of young generations. Instead of focussing on their careers they focuss more on their moblies. They have started communicating less in personnel and more on these sites which is increasing the gap amongst their bonds and affecting their inter-personnel relations. They are so addicted that they click selfies at dangerous places which causes deaths.We can see that children have started playing less outdoor activities instead they keep glued to their phones. Now we can see that even a 10 year old kids have smartphones with them.They play games and cartoons on phones and do less physical activities which is adversely affecting their healths and mental development.Among the elder people technology was not so popular,but these days they too have become slaves of the technology. Earlier the technology was used for information purposes but now they too have started using whatsapp and facebook. People in office can often be seen playing candy crush,subway surfer or surfing facebook which is hampering their efficiency at work places.

For instance, thanks to the invention of electricity ,many products are now produced totally by the control of one computer, saving a great deal odf human effort.At last technology is both hamrful and helpful the impact depends upon human beings.",3.5

Everything near us in the environment is surrounded with technologies.From Toothpaste to kitchen and daily essential everthing is based on technologies.Technologies has made life easier but have negative impact too.Just like taking an example of students then if they are using calculator for calculation then it makes habitate of that , if they are said to do calculation without calculator the it might be possible that they face probles.Technology is required but at some level . There is no need to use technologies for the smaller works or for daily essential works.Mobile phones that we use in daily life is a part of technologies . Even it is not wrong to say that our own crteation i.e. Technology had made us slave. In early 80's or 90's when there was less technologies , then people use to do their work on their own and introduction of various technologies has changed everthing.Few year ago we use pen and paper technique for the exam while now in present time we are using online examination technique. It is quite good as it save wastage of paper and reduces the effort made by examiners to check each and every answer, instead of it they just has to decide an answer for that question and rest of the work is done automaticlly. No need to check it.Technology is getting stronger and stronger each and every day and making people habitate of that. People donn't even think where they stand without technology in hand.Technology has reduced the burden on present generation and has also worked on increasing the efficency of work done .

Not only the youth, but the older generations are also gettimg trapped in the web of technology. All the works which are compulsory to do arround us , are now turned into a new tchnologically advancements. Humans are fully dependent on the machine. If we talk about the housldhold machines then all we can see our motherpreviously cooked food on the gas stoves but now the induction plates changed this too and in past the students used to study through books but this is also changed with the internet facilities. there are many things which have been replaced with the machines. society now a days act as the workers or the slaves under technology.in todays world if mother wants to feed their children then rather then siunging a song they are switched to play an interesting video before their child. students hardly experience the writing they also moved to laptops and other gadgets. yes its true to say that people are more dependent on machines because it makkes the work easier but with this it also turns people to become lasy and habitual. experience the magic of machines it is ruling upon the makers of the same. using the technology is not at all bad but depending on the same will make you the puppets without which you cant even work or think. the techology should be used according to our needs and do not let the technology rule upoin us. the coming generation should not able to experience the joy of hardness and feeling of sweat because of this so called techology. this is time to make the sentence work by taking necessary steps and keeping alive the spirit of hardwork and sweat routing activities...... at last this can be said by the makers of the technology that if technology tries to rule on the head of the introducers to it..... then the makers are the real distroyers......",4.0

As we are standing in 21st century, it is very difficult for us to spend a single day without light or fan or mobile phones. Technology brings all the necessary things to serve our purpose. But beside that fact if we think that we are going to be dependent on technology day by day and lost our creartive nature then will it be justified?Man creates the technologies and then improve the technologies for more and more betterment. But the question is, are we really addicted of technology or become slave of our own creation? Answer is definetly controversial as technology is obviously nedded to serve the basic purposes of humans and environmemnt and without a technology a country can not be improved. Man develops technology and that technology brings jobs for others and they can get a chance to show their talent and creation through the betterment. So need is a common factor for human or environment and technology fulfill that needs. If we think like as we just utilize the effort of making thetechnology then we are utilizing our own creation, not as a slave but as a creator. Creativity should not be lost, it should be improved day by day for betterment of technology,for the sake of the lives and also for the country to make it as a mark in the eye of the world.I disagree with the statement because I do not think that we create anything to be slave of it.

813,3,3_148,"Technology is what humans perceive it to be. Technological innovation is an evil which is of paramount importance for the progress and evolution of humanity. Where on one hand, the advancement in technology has led to development of weapons of mass destruction, it has also led to betterment of health services. Humans, to an extent, have become slaves of the technology - look at the widespread mobile phone addiction or even more grave but less though of - the selfie addiction. Technology which was supposed to ease the life of human beings and make them efficient has instead made them lazy and ineffecient. The need is to sensitise the present as well as the future generation about the judicious use of technology. It is even more important to regulate ourselves with respect to the areas where technological advancement must be focussed - more where it leads to betterment of human civilisation and nil where it leads us to a &#039;MAD&#039; (Mutually Assured Destruction) end. One more important factor to consider is the enviromental question. The technological innovation can either better the environment and its use by us or else worsen the state of environment which will in turn lead to the same fate as stated before. The luxury and laziness that technology has brought in is an addiction which is bound to become a DNA trait of humans. Children have lost interest in outdoor activities and prefer virtual reality based videogames over real sports. The addiction doesn&#039;t end here with children. Youth and the adults too are more inclined towards vehicles and conveyance even for shorter distances. It is common to see people engrossed in their mobile phones at a &#039;social gathering&#039; rather than engaging in real-time social conversations. A photograph or a snapchat update is more important than enjoying the experience of a holiday. This addiction is not only making humans inefficient but also lonely and less of a social being. Technology has definitely made the world smaller and communication is more handy, but it has also made it perspectively small - the world of a 16 year old today is much smaller than it was a decade or so ago - it is virtually large on web but really does not extend beyond the gadgets or devices at home. The need is to sensitise the present as well as the future",4.5

This is somewhere good, as compared to the previous generation today we are living in a era where everything is so fast.

The modern technology has bring new ways to handle the machines and it does not required any hard work and patience for making any component or thing or the product. It can be done automatically with the help of programs or the codes which may be written on the computer and it will done that work automatically and if there is any error then it will detect that error and it will be corrected by the operator or the employee. In various automobile companies, the cars and the trucks are made by the robots, due to which the production of the company and their total turnover was also increases.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes and the like or it can be embedded in machine, computers, devices and factories which can be oprated by individual without detailed knowledge of the working of such things.Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies and has allowed the rise of lower classes. But the more use of technology becomes addiction for the people.Addiction of technology is not easy to recognize especially since many of us must now be plugged in so much of the time whether for work, school or for other reason. We are dependent on technology for our all the works. So technology became addiction for the human beings.Work Dependency:Now a days daily life of the human beings are associated with the technology. We have to use the internet for our works like online payment, searching contents, online shopping, connection with friends etc. So some where we are going to addicted with the use of technology.Lazyness:The reason of technology addiction is the lazyness of the people. They depends on technology for all the works so it became the addiction for human beings.New Trends:The new trends in the life of human beings is also the reason for the addiction of the technology.

People cannot imagine their daily life without the help of technology. Today a daywithout electricity bring large problems to the normal household activitise, the household even cant get water to drink without electricity . The another bless of technology is the smart phones , today people used to remain so busy in their phone that they dontbother to spend time with their family . Today virtual world is taking the place of real world, people start living in virtual world more than the real world .

Today many forest are being destroyed for making industries , many wild life are getting extinct , but still people dont care about the nature .Years ago when electricity was discovered it was a blessing , but today we are fully dependent on it . we cannot imagine how people used to live then.

Everytime when a new technology comes, there is something new innovative enhancements in it. So learning a new technology will ensure me to learn something innovative which will add value to me in my future career.Since nowadays latest technologies are more preferred in the various sectors of the companies including IT industries. Whenever it comes to learning to a new technology, i get more excited to know about that technolgy.Like recently i attended Internet of Things (IOT) a new technology which is nowadays more preferred in industries. Through this Internet of Things I got to know about the various devices used in that technology. It included a Raspberry pi2 model which was a mini-microprocessor chip having a capacity of 2gb RAM and also a sensors were used for detecting the various senses. Learning a new technology enhances to create our own new ideas using that technology. Nowadays whenever a new technology comes into the market, its demand is increased in the market if it has several advantages over the previous technologies depending on the hardware and software resources, economic cost and so on.It is also checked whether it is feasible or not to use the software for the respective new technology. Learning a new technology for the information technology and computer engineering graduates is very much in need since they have to keep updated with the existing new technologies. This is because whenever a new technology arise ,if it is very much in demand then various industries try to upgrade to that technology,so its mandatory for IT sectored individuals to get updated to the new technologies.

Technology is used in homes, offices, schools, colleges, railways etc. I agree with this statement that technology has become a new addiction. As if we talk about technology than our day starts using technology i.e. Switching off alarm on mobile phone, Taking water from RO and while bathing we use geezers for hot water than make breakfast in microwave and watching TV or listening FM. Than we work on Laptops or Personal computer.So all this shows our addiction towards technologies. Everyone in this world is aware how badly this technology is affecting our body. Now a days kids love to use mobile phonesas there best time pass. Technology stops there overall development that is health and mental development. In villages the death age is 99 or 100 and in cities it is 60 or 65 because the rays from technology are affecting our body directly or indirectly.New new diseases arises because of the misuse of technology. Nowadays,no one can understand the value of money the rich buys number or air conditioners for their home the gases from this technologies are depleting theozone layer and because of this skin problems are found.Everything has its pros and cons so let us talk about the benefits of technologies. If we want cold water than we have refrigerator, If we want cool air we have air conditioner, If we want to listen the songs than Television is available to us, If we don't want to work on sheets than we have laptop tp keep our data safe and secure. Technology makes our life effortless because technology makes our works easier we can send data while sitting at single place.",3.5

The scientist, engineers, doctors etc. make a new technology of word where a person can do thier respective work easily. The technology become a new addition and people used this addition in his/her daily routine.The best examle of technology is internet. Without internet the people donot survive in this era .Internet not only used for the communication but also it helps for marketing , accounting, jobs, etc. All of us depend on this technology and without this we didnot able to a walk a distance in life. The technology make us a slave because each and every this is done by the technology. Weare the workers and technology is the boss who compeled us to work according to technology. But theres a lot adverse effect on technology because now a days terrorists, hackers etc missusing this technology and they use more advance technology as compared to us.Technology gies us a defination of rest because each and everything is done easily without any effort. In the upcomming era i think people didnot drink a clas of water without using technology. The computers are having sharper mind than a common man although it was discovered by a man.

Talking about technology almost within every month we come up with some new technology. And its all 'Man Creation'. As it is known 'man invented a computer '. Coming up of new technologies has made things or rather one's life easier. Viz nowadays you will find almost all high tech machines in offices, home etc.Earlier days people used to rely on themselves for completing the task but now they al are relying on computers or machines. For eg. latest invention of the driverless car which was in news tells us how the addiction has been increasing. Every indivual is so much dependent on it that they are forgetting the beauty of one's own creation. Lets talk about those early days where mothers used to get early in morning to prepare lunc for their kids , but now a days they depend on toaster ,microwave, induction to save time.As we know that every thing has its bad and postive effect. But we are clever if we are choosing that way which doesn't effect us.Because of technology there are many health issues and it is very common in children. Because of new inventions we all have TVs , laptop, etc at home and we stucked up in that only and we have forgotten the beauty of nature. And at last we all are ready to accept new change in technology but not in ourselves , because it takes a lot of effort to do things without the help of machine. And yes we are 'slaves of technolgy ' if there is no then we all are 'numb beings' not 'human beings'.",3.5

Where 1st industrial revolotion is conducted in United Kingdom. Thereafter this revolution spread world wide. Now a days people cannot run a single day without technology. For a proper human life, from waking up in the morning to get back to sleep is the use of technology.In mordern era, this was somerevolutionary action for those the scenario of whole world become changed. First of all the invention of electronics at 19th century, for which we can anything within a fraction of second. But the size of the equipment was so large that they could notbe ported, as they were made by valve tube gadgets.At the middle of tweentyth century, semi-conductor was discovered. It brings a great action as the size of instrument become smaller. So varrious impossible works at that era became possible. At that time television and telephones were invented. this is the a valueable step which brings forward the electronic communication media. Later on those communication was done by elecromagnetic waves wireless media.Butthere is also a dark side of technology. It makes our lesser efficent in daily. People somehow uses their technolgy for excessive selfishness or relaxation. Which actually creates the difference of cast and classes in our society. Technology is used in war now a day.Human right and peacefulness is tremendously by this fact. People use internet for somthing illegal for which a nation gets severe threats sometime. Terrorism is being done by using internet links. Our valuable data gets insecure by the world of hackers.So keeping all points in mind we have to do such an action so that we should drive technology for betterment, not driven by technology for our own destruction.",3.5

913,3,3_320,"In a time where mankind has access to everything, technology plays the most vital role. In terms of social, cultural and humanitarian grounds, nothing has taken the lead spot except for technology. Bringing this to the front, I would take my stand and say that it has become an addiction that one would struggle to come out of. The major standpoint is to realize that we are living in a world that is controlled by machines and which in a few more generations would be completely taken over by the techno freaks.As a coin has two sides, so does everything that exists. Taking the pros into consideration, we can rely on the fact that without technology and gadgets, life would not have found such a profound importance in all matters. There was a time when each had its own unique capability. The alarm clock for waking us up, the camera to take pictures, the notebook to write things on and so on. But today, the &#039;Mobile&#039; has swept over the world as being the gadget with all the accessories needed for survival. We rarely find someone without a mobile. Everything is done with that small gadget. You get connected to people living in other countries and relationships become easy. All the daily needs are neatly arranged and taken care of. Infact, technology has made wonders that nobody believed could be done. It has erased impossibility. Mankind has come to the point where he claims to be the Divine being. I do agree with the point that we have evolved and have made things so easy but that does not solve all.The armoury for wars, the technology to kill, steal and manipulate things, and everything else has made life difficult. Talking about the cons, one would certainly understand that no matter the good and useful things that happen, no one can deny the fact that there are same many disadvantages as advantages. Though people are connected from different countries, yet in a family there is hardly enough time spent talking with each other as each are busy with their own gadgets. Hackers have misused technology for stealing and corrupting. The list would go on. So technology has both pros and cons.Today, through technology we get all our things done right from our basic needs to every comfort. Online shopping has become a hotcake with people getting food, recharges, clothes and everthing that you can name. We begin our day by looking at the phone and we end it with that. So, all that we do is live with technology. In this case, I would like to say that mankind has forgotten the originality of finding and knowing things and has made himself lazy and workless by depending on technology for everything. We have become so dependant on technology that if it ceases to exist, I&#039;m sure that mankind would die a slow death. Hence, we have become slaves of technology. We, who considered ourselves as creators have become mere slaves to the things we created. We have become fools trying to call ourselves God.",4.5

One reason is that we have enough arms and weapons and they are very talented and they know how to handle the situation.So the main advantage with nuclear production is that it helps to protect our country.

The most heard of argument in the debate over the nuclear strength of the country is that the country is increasing its production rate of nuclear weapons so as to strengthen its defense against other countries and terrorism, which to some extents seems understandable with the increase in terrororism in the last decades or so, every country is taking every possible step they can to protect itself agaisnt the violence and threat of terrorism.But the race these countries have entererd into in the name of defensive stratergieshas also brought them losses.

The development of Science and Technology have emerged a lot in military. Different wepons and armaments havebeen manufactured to fight in the war. This helped to win wars and also helped in the development of a nation. Influence of these weapons have been very useful and it acts as a protecting tool. Every country have been working towards the rapid development of the nuclear development. This development will change the face of a nation in the world. These have reduced the involvement of human during wars and save their life. These nuclear development weapons are used in various fields of life such as military, science and technology,medical etc.DISADVANTAGES: Even though these weapons are very useful they have many disadvantages. The influence of theese armars have greately reduced the involvement of human race in every walks of life. The rays from these nuclear products may cause a great threat to human health. The nature have been dwelling and water level have been reduced. They can lead to natural calamities. Some try to use these weapons to earn money and cause damage to human life.

There are various examples we have came across in which the production of these arms and weapons has caused a great disaster to mankind. The basic motive of of production of arms and weapons in todays era is to show the nations strength and power across the globe.If we see our past for digging the cause for production of arms and weapons we can see that in various mythalogical stories and mythalogical books it is written that arms and weapons are produced for ones defence not for showing their power.There are various Instances wher we heard of various nations threatening each others of their arm or weaponary power.If we take the example from the recent past we have seen North Korea threatening our of its nuclear weaponaries.Superpowers on earth want to conquer the entire world. This is the main reason that triggered the nuclear race in the world.As its pros we can say that there is advancement in the weaponary technology.If one country is having say for example nuclear weapons so other countries should have the same advanced weaponaries otherwise thy have the fear of being suppresed by the the nations having them.So, there are only two methods for this problem that is either all the countries should have that or all the countries should not have that.If we talk about the cons of this topic we can say that there is a serious threat to whole human race because of the existence of these kind of disasterous weaponery across the globe.At last is just want to conclude by saying that serious steps should be taken with the approval of all the countries over the production of these disastrous weapons.",3.5

The sudden increment in these have not only caused threat to single nations but have endangered whole world. Hollywood movies try to explain how nuclear war can end this whole world. Yet in terms of safety namesake countries are violating the uno regulations and are continuosly incresing there production of arms. countries like pakistan are using their umployed talented youngsters in illegal production and possession of arms. There are numerous pros and cons of this endless race. As far as pros are concerned , countries feel safe from each other. Aarms are a neccesity to eliminate national threats .Had it been not used,then terrorist groups like alqaeda and mujahedeen would have rose to there supremacy . Who can forget the deadly 9/11 attack . Terrorist like Osama bin laden takes no shame and considered it a holy act . Attacks like 26/11 in mumbai shook whole world. As such in order to eliminate these threats advanced weapons and arms are a neccesity for the proper safety and integrity of nations. The best and latest example is Uri attack where brave soldiers where martyred . It was just because of advancement in arms and weapons technology that india could do surgical strike and gave strong reply to anti national terrorists.

Even countries like france are suffering from these threats . thus in order to tackle these problems , advancement is a neccesity. let us discuss the cons of this endless race now. few countries have attained a mentality to showcase their suprimacy over other nations ,as such they are using all possible arms technology to threaten other countries.

As we know that the use of nuclear weapons is very harmful to nature as It exhibits the chemical smokes that can be disastrous for our earth. The production of nuclear weapons also reduces the economy power of a country as the production must be expensive and it takes a lots of resources and money to get in to modern's nuclear development. As we seen that the technology has been growing day by day so It is also increasing the competition to make new weapons among the countries. But It has a positive side also because suppose if the opposition wants to get induldge in a war. Then they could defend themselves so In order to defend themselves they must be top in the production of arms and weapons in the era of Nucleae development. The production of nuclear weapons is also the major factor of pollution as It harms our nature by its chemical smoke and also affects the human beings. for example:- When Russia dropped the nuclear weapon on the Vietnam than there was many peoples died because of the destroyous weapon and its chemical smoke that gets in to their lungs and causes death immediately. As we know, that the money which gets in the production of arms and nuclear weapons developments is of huge amount that can be used to remove the poverty of a country by 100 times. So in order to get economical strong, They should spend their money on the peoples rather than to spend on the arms and Nuclear Weapons.

And he is not using those powers for the sake of himself.another example in cartoon channels power rangers.They will use their powers to help people who are in danger situation.they will help every people who are in need or in danger.the best examplke we can discuss that fire extingisher.It is helpful when in any place if fire accident is done.Immediately they will come to that place when we have informed they will be available always to help people.so final conclusion is superpowers should be useful for the humans and they donot harm the humans.any power in this world should be useful for human sake and they not to do harm.If in that case the super powers is not good to humans then they should not be certified by the government and immediately they should be banned if in case instruments thet should",1.5

978,5,5_259,"An arms race, in its orginal usage, is a competition between two or more parties to have the best armed forces. Each party competes to produce larger numbers of weapons, greater armies, superior military technology, etc. in a technological escalation.International conflict specialist Theresa Clair smith, defines the terms as ""the participation"" of two or more nations -states in apparently competitive or interactive increases in quantity or quality of of war material and persons under arms. The term is also used to describe a competitive situation, in which the purpose is only to be more successful than one's competitors.From the dates 1891 to 1919, an arms race between several European counteries, including Germany, France, Russia took place. British concern about rapid increase in the German naval power resulted in costly building competition of Dreadnought class ships. This tense arms race lasted until june 1914, when after two antagonistic power blocs were formed because of the rivalry, the World War broke out. If it weren't for this arms race, World War 1 may never have tken place, as the governments of these nations would not had felt that they have the military technology and navies to risk their citizens in the war.A nuclear arm race developed during the Cold war, an intense period between the Soviet Union and the United States and some other counteries. This was one of the main causes that began the cold war. On both sides, perceived advantages of the adversary led to large spending on armaments and the stockpilling of vast nuclear arsenals. Proxy wars were fought all over the world in which the super powers conventional weapons were pitted against each other.So in context it is ver harmful for the human beings and the nature of the Earth also and if it will be continued then it will be end of the whole mankind on these Earth.",4.0

983,5,5_207,The race in the production of arms and weapons in the era of nuclear development is very useful. Through this means of production whole man kind is put in the higher states. The arms and weapons is must essential for the facing of crictical situations. Army now requires a greater amount of weapons inorder to protect the nation from several harmful effects. Wih out these production there is nothing to achieve . And success can be achieved with a greater extent. Superpowers on earth want to conquer the entire world because due to the help of these weapons production it can be greater helpful. So the requirement is first and foremost essential. And the race has to be followed till the end untill the success is reached. Hence by the production of these useful and wanted arm and weapon production race can be followed according to our manner. And usage of these superpowers on earth triggerd a nuclear race but it should be essential to follow. One must take certain precautions inorder to face the ill effects caused by the usage of weapons.But the important point is that nuclear development is challenging the very existence of human beings. Hence according to my aspects this race is useful to the greater extent for the growth of whole mankind. And this race has no end since it undergoes various challenges day by day inorder to secure the mankind. Thus by this way it is cleared to say thtat nation can be achieved to the reqired place or position by the usage of this weapon production. Today we can a greater persons loosing their life in the army inordr to protect our country to those who are working for the country not even worrying about their deadth his production helps a lot.

Nations are spending millions of dollars for this research. Eventhough it won't provide any benefits to the people welfare, only to showcase the superiority among other nations countries have been priotising this.The advantages by realizing the nuclear weapons is, they can setup the nuclear power plants. In which it enhances the electricity availability. The countries which cannot avail the other sources of energy generation can use this technology. This is the only advantage of spending some time and money on nuclear tests.Nuclear weapons had caused the severe losses to both mankind and environment drastically. The unhealthy competition among the world super powers during the world war had created a great impact on the lives of japan and the rest of some other parts of the world. Many countries had taken this as a challenge to perform nuclear tests. Securing this weapons had created an prestigious issue among nations.

By removing or adding a few electrons to an atom, a scientist can make the most lethal weapon in the world. Utilising the benefit of this advancement, the Super Nations of the Earth want to keep their status of power or even overpower other Nations at the cost of the lives of the innocents.The Nuclear Arms Race came into existence after the World War II. The United States and its allies had the intention to thwart the power of the Soviet Union and wanted to crush the influence USSR had on the global communism. For this, both the Superpowers started stockpiling nuclear warfares. Even after the end of the Cold War, the Big Nations continue with their collection. Its not just the Super Nations now but even the smaller nations and the developing countries are found to have developed this sense of gathering nuclear weapons.

1008,5,5_281,"Challenges to Nuclear Deterrence in the Second Nuclear Age""A world without nuclear weapons would be less stable and more dangerous for all of us""- Margaret ThatcherThis line of neorealist thinking has its origin in the cold war period which saw proliferation of nuclear weapons technology both vertically and horizontally.They claim that in 1945 the 'cold war' remained cold because the two superpowers USA and USSR both possessed nuclear weapons.The development of second strike capability i.e. ability to strike back against the nuclear aggresor ensures that the deterrence of terror is strong enough to desist any nation from engaging in any nuclear adventurism.Deterrence is a strategic concept and has been central to the renewing and planned use of nuclear weapons since the immediate period after 1945. It is the aim of preventing an opponent to act in a given way by convincing them that they face undesirable consequences if they dont retreat.On its first significant incarnation , as the atom bomb, the nuclear weapon was viewed as the ultimate weapon of combat warfare. Since then every powerful nations have made huge investment in nuclear field and this has led to immense advancement of nulcear weapons.Opponents say that the nuclear power poses numerous threats to people and the environment and questions are asked if it will ever be a sustainable energy source.These threats include health risks and environmental damage from Uranium mining ,processing and transport, the risk of nuclur weapons proliferation or sabotage ,and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. Critics do not believe that these can be reduced through technology.Three of the world's four largest economies now all generate more electricity from non -hydro renewable energy than from nuclear sources.So i believe that superpowers on earth has entered in a race for nuclear advancement which may lead to end of earth.",3.5

Two cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed and no trace of the cities was left. Even Robert Oppenheimer the lead of the Manhattan project regrets taking part in the annhilation. Japan itself condemend the action and deemed it inhumane. The huge nuclear accidents are also very destructive. Various cities like Chernobryl are rendered inhabitat because of a nuclear accidents.But there is a silver lining to nuclear power.Lack of renewable resources is a problem all around the world. It creates pollution and also exhausts thenatural resources which take millions of years to accumulate.Nuclear energy is considered to be a form of never ending energy because of how much power we can produce with only a little amout of input. Today nuclear energy is frowned upon because of wastes it genrates. However this race between nations can encourage them to put more efforts into nuclear research and development. Few isotopes of Uranium are said to be able to create huge amout of energy and have no waste products at all. There have been major nuclear accidents but makind has to learn from their mistakes and do more research in this regard.Both good and evil prevail together more often than not. But it is upto us to strike a balance between the two. For example electricty was frowned upon at the begining but today we cannot imagine a life without it. Similarly if the race is more focused on the progress of mankind instead of building arms and weapons the result will be fruitful.

It made cooking so easy with the advancements from a 'Chulah' to 'Gas-Stove' and then to 'Microwaves'. It reduced the time consuming and tiring task ofhouse cleaning into an easy task with the help of 'vacumm-cleaners'.It increased communication between people.

Though nations have signed and are framing out various ways to disarm their nuclear arsenal in way in which the world order and peace is not disturbed.To summarize it all, nuclear development, nuclear technology is good if we emphasize on its pros, like civil usage of nuclear technology for better and cleaner environment, to maintain deterrence against our enemies which has till now worked really well as it has not allowed any confrontation between some big super powers, and hasn't led to any major war. Apart from it nuclear technology and development has also opened doors for development and research of many new sectors. Major disadvantage of nuclear technology is their security, efforts involved in their R&D and lack of accountability of nuclear possessing nations",3.5

The competition for acquring an upper hand is growing day by day. Every country wants to be the greatest and conquer the entire world due to this the human race poses a threat. Nuclear development has advantages and disadvantages too. By the devepoment of new weapons a country can safeguard its boundaries. This also helps in protecting the country in tough situations like war. A country which donot have weapons during war may face many difficulties and may face defeat. The development of nuclear weapons indicate the development of science and technology.Though the development of weapons can be seen as the results of science and technology it eventually causes a threat to the existence of human race. According to the surveys it is known fact that the nuclear weapons available today can destroy the whole world just in a few minutes. The countries which are developing these weapons are also under threat as this leads to the release of harmful gases. As best example we can consider Hiroshima and Nagasaki incident. Many people still suffer from the nuclear effects caused by the explotion. The explosion of a nuclear station also is biggest threat to the people. The people arroundthe nuclear stations suffer from evil effects.Though there are many evil effects Super powers on earth want to conquer the entire world.

This has taken a new shape in mordern era.Both the world wars have given proof that war cannot be won by only human power but with requisiteadvanced weaponry, themore the better.World war I(1911) had powerful leaders fighting over territories while world war II(1939-1945) gave us the light of the most deadliest weapons,nuclear weapons.

Developments in nuclear techonology has lead to the manufacturing of weapons that are far more superior to the past day arms like machine guns and hand-granides.

Nuclear bombs generally work on the principle of fusion or fission making them to engulf the matter that is present around them and that only ends when the process slows down. For example, the nuclear tests on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. America launched its first nuclear weapons on Japan decades before but the affects of it still haunt the place. The heat produced killed people not even leaving their ashes, people burned down, blown away into pieces, families lost their loved ones' and in some place even the whole families disappeared. it felt like the whole place was swept away leaving no trace of humanity behind.

1096,5,5_236,"The arms and weapons were initially made to save one's land/country/nation from the others. Then, the other countries realised that they also need such weapons to save themselves from the rest. And this kept on growing. It has now grown to such an extent that everyone is craving to get the power of weapons. Everyone wants to have mini guns for themselves as 'a weapon for self protection'. But, these weapons are not used as a weapon of defence. Having a weapon gives one a power, so if he faces even a small dispute, he'd get so angry that he pulls out his gun to threaten the other. The terrorists, for example, are using weapons for their so called rights, which they may get if they are willing to have a decent conversation with the goverment. Those who don't use weapons, would go for protests. Are guns and protests only things left to get the rights? No. But, yes, if the government gives a sum of Rs.10,000 and a sewing machine to the rapist and a murderer, one would really not consider trusting the govenment. The court cases are just files to be completed for some government officials. ""Justice delayed is justice denied"", why don't people get it? Why do court cases last adecade or two? I talked of the problems of the common man only. The same goes on thelarger scale as well. Countries should have a mutual agreement rather than a war. I mean, that if, for example, Pakistan and India have some form of agreement in which both countries let each other live and work peacefully, if say Pak finds that some of their citizens are not following the agreement, the Pak government should itself take appropriate actions with complete honesty. How peaceful the nations and their residents will be? Weapons made for defence should always be used for defence and not as a mode to judge or prove who is more powerful!",4.0

They were affected from many genetic dieseases and the veggitation is still destroyed till the time. The destruction was so powerful that till now also their is no chancesof lifethere .Many people died of the trauma and also still suffering from different diseases with a different genetic structure. There are no chances of life in that area in today's time as well.

People were shifted from their houses to some safer placesand everyone has to wear those masks so that they won't inhale those gases.

The most dangerous country regarding nuclear threat is North Korea. North Korea regularly test their nuclear weapons and missiles and threaten all other countries by telling about their nuclear power.

Many countries do not want to start war as they are afraid of nuclear attacks. Due to race in nuclear development, more choices will be available for developing countries for import of nuclear arms.

It is a threat to the existence of human beings. Pollution caused by nuclear tests is really very dangerous for our environment.

The lust for power led to the First World War and to rule the whole world led Adolf Hitler to be the most rebellious leader lurking to be the most powerful. To be powerful is to have an economy which sustains the cost of arms and weapons which has led most of the countries in the modern era to build an economy which not only sustains their army but also develops and enhances its artillery aswell, The United States of America, China, Russia, France, Indiaare allexample of economies which have well sustained and developed their army and weapons, but what of the poor economies? Like the African Sub-continent, they face a constant fear of being overpowered by countries which have developed their nuclear warheads to attack any country in the world. This constant fear of being crushed, victored and terrorize smaller economies has often lead to the discussion of existence of human beings. This race to the production of arms and weapons has brought smaller economies to focus on their nuclear development rather than focusing on their population. It's the common people of every nation which faces the most problems due to the constant development of nuclear arms. If a country focueses only on its arms and weapons, the economy will soon fail. To avoid such a scenario in the common world it is important for a country to focus on both aspects of the development of nuclear warheads. Also, nuclear attacks on Hiroshima And Nagasaki proved to be devastating in the Second World War, Japanesse in those parts still face the consequences of those attacks, so the question arises that : Should we really be focusing on nuclear development with its adverse consequences?",4.5

If the stoge-age used stones or the natural metals, the new man used the combination of chemicals and poisonous substances, which have directed away the actual need for the invention of weapons.

The world&s highest arms manufacturing is done in the United states which is one of the most powerful countries in the world if not the most.

India just signed a deal to buy fighter jets from France and tanks from russia, India signed a deal with Bangladesh to export our fighter jets to them. This sorts of weapons trades are very expensive deals and are very important for the economy of any country.Secondly, i would like to state that there are UN treaties signed and agreed by powerful countries to avoid the use of nuclear weapons even in case of a war. Also there are treaties signed between countries to help each other with respect to intelligence information, arms manufacturing, defence deals and so on. India and US just signed deals on using american defense system and intelligence to spot out terrorist attacks and other threats. Every country knows what impact a nuclear war can have on the; not only will it destroy their economy but it will literally wipe them out of existence. Now US has 250+ nuclear heads, Russia has around 200 and suprisingly pakistan has more nuclear weapons than india.In case any country wishes to destroy another, it will need only a maximum of 5 nuclear weapons at most. Majority of the nuclear countries have atleast 5 nukes, so basically anyone can destroy one another. So, the possibility of a nuclear attack is difficult cosidering any country is capable of attacking and hence avoiding nukes is the best policy.Finally, I would like to say that whether superpowers on earth want to or don&t want to conquer the entire world, the nuclear race was inevitable as every country wants to be secured enough to feel safe and be able to defend itself from invaders.",4.5

There are a lot of pros and cons to this race.The country which has a lot of nuclear weapons are often feared and respected by other countries. This is good in establishing relationships with other countries. It also gives a warning to the enemy countries. so that they will not dare to attack them. The United States of America and Russia are two such countries. Their huge nuclear arsenal makes them the two most feared military in the world. They use it to their advantage as they have ties with various countries and their opinion is greatly valued by other nations. They can also act as a peacekeeper in certain situations.The main disadvantage of this race is that nuclear weapons have a devastating effect if used. They can wipe out cities with a single weapon and the effects can last for generations. We all know what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the kids born in these cities have various genetic disorders due to the impact of the radiation. These nuclear weapons in the wrong hands are a threat to the entire world. If these weapons falls in the hands of terrorists then the after effects would be catastrophic. One main example is the rivalry between India and Pakistan. Due to the strained relationship between the two countries after the Independence, both countries have been on a spree to develop advanced weapons. As we all know Pakistan have started sponsoring terrorism to cause havoc and destruction to our country. If they provide these weapons to the terrorists then a full fledged Nuclear war can be expected which will have a devastating effect to the entire subcontinent.Thus Nuclear weapons development has various advantages and disadvantages. These weapons should not be used unless the existence of the country is in danger. These weapons should not be used to threaten nations. Judicious and wise use of the weapons is needed to keep the world safe and in peace to prevent a third world war.",3.5

We have seen the destroy of countries and many people who lost their lifes due to world wars. In world war 1 and world war 2 many people scarifies their lifes for their country. If many countries encourages nuclear arms and weapons it may lead to world war 3. If world war 3 occurs no human being is alive on earth.

There is another country which is danger to world that is Pakisthan which is also has lot of nuclear weapons and arms supporting country like China.

1156,5,5_374,"The topic is under the discussion of ""Nuclear development"". Coming to the topic, production of arms and weapons in the era of nuclear development is very challenging the existence of human beings. Ofcourse, it is quite important also. In the modern old, nuclear things are very important to mankind. Here, i am going to describe the pros and cons of the development.Coming to pros, nuclear weapons plays a major role in the nuclear fields. They give support to the people. They protect the whole systems in the entire project. Due to these, the electricity may also developed. They protect the country from certain problems. They are the supportive systems to the environment. During war time, these nuclear weapons plays a significant role. Nuclear development is the super power on earth. We can say, it is the most wanted gift from god. Nuclear development has triggered a nuclear race in the world. So, this is very imporant to implement more projects on nuclear development systems.Coming to the cons, nuclear development is very dangerous to the environment. There must be a certain maintainance to the nuclear systems. Unless there is no maintainance it could become very dangerous. The things used in the making of nuclear weapons are more expensive. If certain protection is not given, it may lead to explotion. In these conditions, the entire environment may be damaged. So, a lot of protective and carefull measures are taken by the government. One should be very carefull about the nuclear systems. care taking persons are allowed to protect the system. The proper amount of electricity should be passed otherwise, it may damage the system and undergoes explosion. Do not allow every one near to the place where the entire system is present. So, we can say that although it is very usefull, it is somewhat dangerous to the environment.On the last,we can conclude that as a coin has both the faces, this nuclear development also has both pros and cons. So, by taking preventive measures this nuclear development has to be implemented. Otherwise, it may leads to the explosion.",2.5

Today several types of robots are developed they do many things simultaniously and efficient than humen beings.In future may be the robots are controled our world .These all createddue to the nuclear race in the world.some times it's good but some times it's very bad thing.we cannot imagine that one day the superpower machines will control the entire world. we konw that so many useful things are produced by using nuclear techonology but still there are some disadvantages in this field.the Nuclear race in the world is need but not limitles .The race is only for the good of humen being,2.5

The rate of production of weapons is multipling every year The production of neuclear power is harmfull for human beings. It is challenging the existence of human beings. weapons are very much harmful for us.They can destroy the world. And facing them is too challenging.Now, In this neclear development era every country want to make powerful weapons like bombs misiles etc. But now this became a race among contries.This is the race to become powerful in the world. But this is challenging for human beings.This need lot of money in production whicheffects the economy of a country. If a country invest great amount of money for production of weapons then it may become berrier for the growth of the perticular country.Everyday this race is incresing only because every country want superpowers. I think these are not the superpower. A thing that is made to destroy world then how it become superpower in terms of humanity.One should use power only for wellness ofhuman beingsnot to rule them.But now the superpower does exists in form of neuclear power.And with help of this superpower everyone want to conquer the entire world. Today, it is seems like gaining superpower is become passion for everyone.But there are many disadvantages of weapons.let Pakistan as a example, This country is now focusing only in the production of neuclear bombs and weapons. And this is very harmful for their youngsters bacause after few year they will not be able to even survive . I think, country should focus on skills of students and development of country.but still they are focusing on developing weapons.This may harmful for the country because development of a country depend on youth.As we know every thing has two sides and it has also.Yes, we need superpower but not to conqure the entire world but to save our country and also helping to others.hence production of weapon also need.",2.5

So finally it is usefull to the mankind to live.ofcourse superpowers on earth wants to conquer the entire world because due to the triggerring of nuclear race in the world.but these superpowers are neccesary to protect our country to attacked by others suddenly and also to attack the nightmare countries who are regularly attacking us.

Most of the weapons are used by the military people in order to protect our country. The nuclear developement is challenging theexistence of human beings because in olden days the people used the nuclear weapons in order to preotect their lives. By using nuclear weapons at any place the human beings cant survive in that place because in nuclear bombs manufacture they use several dangerous chemicals by smelling those gases people cause so many disesases. The race in the production of arms and weapons are very essential to survive. Army people wants these arms and weapons beacuse in order to fight with the opposite country they need so many weapons and arms and have to protect their life. the nuclear developement is a challenging one it needs so much of chemicals to implement it an also government permission to implement it the work force used for this developemnet is also very high power. The race in this production of arms and weapons are very useful for the whole mankind to protect themselves from the enemy they need weapon compulsory. superpowers on earth want to conquer the entire world because superpowers on earth has triggered a nuclear race in the world.Superpowers sometimes useful to mankind and in some cases they cause harmful to human beings.For example if a man containing superpowers the powers are used in a correct way it will helpful to the world where as if they used in a wrong purpose the entire world have to suffer because wrong way leads to so many people's death. so there is a devel,2.5

Since we know that a coin has two face in the similar manner nuclear development has also the positive as well as negative impact over the humans and all the species existing on this earth. As the technology is boosting day by day in this existing era, production of arms and weapons are increasing. For the protection of our country these developments are very necessary, arms and weapons are very useful for our Indian Army,our soldiers to protect our country from the terrorists hence, it increases the security of our country. Arms and weapons are very useful for the self defence also as the corruption and crime is increasing rapidly. So, with the help of growing technology we are moving towards the development of the country. But, on the other hand increasing production of arms and weapons has a very severe and negative effect over the whole mankind. In the production of more and more weapons humans are lost somewhere, everyone is busy in their race. If this will last ,then definitely after some years we will be diminished. As pollution is also increasing with the production of arms and weapons, humans are facing severe problems because the weapons are used by the criminals also, they are attacking the ordinary people without any reason as we are very much aware of the attack of terrorists on the school children in pakistan where the killed many innocents without any reason. So with the useful effects weapons also have adverse effect on our society and our country. Now the superpowers on Earth want to conquer the entire world. This has triggered the nuclear race in the world. So, the government should take some steps to limit the use of weapons, it should be used for country's protection and not in the hands of terrorists.

Furthermore, it is in human nature to seek better place than that of its competitiors, always, which is resulting into a retaliatory war in terms of arms and weapons' production. It is the most common assumption, or a myth, that the superpower and the nuclear weapons are positively proportionate to each other. Such narrow hypothesis, i.e., ""If the production and development in the nuclear power of a nation increases, the probablility for it to conquer the world will also increase"", gives a reflection to every country for priortizing its investment in nuclear weapons than in the welfare of its citizens, if it wants to rule over the world. Recently, during the surgical strikes made by Indian government across LOC resulted in the endless disussions and comparisons between the nuclear power possessed by both India and Pakistan, also their supporting superpowers. The core reason for making such a comparison was that if any of these countries (India and Pakistan) announces an open war, then which country has a high probability to succeed, keeping in mind, its nuclear sources and that of its supporting superpowers. However, what I did not understand was that why we all are fighting at all? When we all belong from a same origin and ultimately desires peace!As per my school of thought, a superpower should considered to be the one who maintains a good give and take relation with every possible country, it is in contact with, which believes in equality and doesn't believe in doing bad of other nations.

The World Wars have wreaked havoc in our planetary society so far. The bits and pieces of information that even remind us of the catastrophic dangers of war is enough to make us shiver and withdraw ourselves in our shells. So, there can be no or very little good coming from waging and fighting wars. However, the general populace say that &war is necessary&. Mankind as a whole, it seems to me, has become very &convining&, to put it into a single word. We have become divided by nature of the excuse that we need to be independant and also the excuse of development or growth of the constituent nations of the world&s society. I feel that wars are useless, for the most part. Their small bit of usefulness is in the control of the population. &Population explosion& is a silent killer in itself. So, war is a catalyst to trigger the harms and problems of the explosion of population. However, usefulness of war (being so little in itself) is very insignificant. Additionally, war may be looked upon as something which is &godly& or even &cool& to the youth (who have tender and impressionable minds). The young, through the example of video games that feature bloodshed and violence as major themes in them, may find it fun to rip, shred or kill other living beings in the video game. They should keep such mindsets in the games they play themselves. Such behaviours in reality though will certainly have their own host of problems such as having to face punishments. On the other hand, there is a clear contradiction to this point that we find and it is that the youth are the people of the future. Yes, it is for them that the world exists, in layman terms.

The race behind which all the people are mad for may sometimes be very efficient and profittable for the country. The army and navy people of the country work day and night for the betterment of their countries at the borders to prevent it from other attacking countries. This nuclear weapons and arms may destroy the attacking countries people and their weapons. The Government also supports the country in these cases when needed. The nuclear arms and weapons protects the entire country from the attacking country and make the citizens live peacefully without any fear of any wars that can cause damage to the country and to themselves. Now-a-days Government spends a lot of money on these to make their country feel secured and protected at any time. Soldiers at the borders works endlessely entire day only to protect their country and citizens of their country neglecting their life.Some of the superpowers on Earth wants to conquer the entire world. This dream of the superpowers have already made a lot of damages to the 'Mother Earth' without considering the side effects of those damages or without the knowledge. The main example for this nuclear race that caused damage to both Earth and the Mankind is the 'Nuclear Attack o Hiroshima and Nagasaki'. This attack is still a nightmare for the people of HIroshima and Nagasaki. it has turned to be a curse to the people of those countries. The people still are affected from that attack. There are still some problems related to respiratory and skin problems.Some are born with defects due to the chemicals that are exploded due to the attack. This nuclear attack has always been considered the most dangerous attack till date. It has always the disadvantages and never the advantages.The another example for the attack may be on WTC(World Trade Center). The attack was the most most dangerous one and took lives of the innocent people. It also caused damage to the economy of the United States and many other countries that associated with the center as the attack was done on the trade center. Due to this attack the data that was collected and stored was destroyed in no time.while discussing about the nuclear race we always can see the Darker side of this Race. It has always caused damage to the Earth and mankind. The attack has made in the raise of the Global Warming which effects the Earths Temperature and by which the Ozone layer that protects the Earth from UltraViolet rays is deplecting day by day.,3.0
1236,5,5_420,"The race in the development of weapons are proceeding day by day.The production of weapons now becoming a day to day activity for a mankind the large number of productions of arms make the danger for the people living in the earth.Because large number of nuclear power are plants are established now a days due to which loss to human life is one of the factors which is existing among people because these weapons are so harmful that it can destroy the whole nation if some damage occurs in these power places it also spreads pollution and the dirty winds comung through these sectors increases many deseases like cholera , diarroheo, many lungs diseases and also the big diseases like cancer ,skin cancer are also increases due the advancements in these fields .The nuclear power plants are a bunch of energy tide in an area which has tendency to destroy many areas if it breaks.Also these nuclear development is beneficial because the large production of dams and places which require this energy are increasing simultaneously side by side.The industries need large production of nuclear energy for the making of the products due to ehich the sales in the market of these industries also increases without the development of nucklear energy it is ver hard for the country to compete with the counteries because beside india yhe other countries are well developes and rich in the part of developing many machines which do not require man labour so the development is procceding in such a state that it is necessary for nation to win the race.The development of weapons helps us to fight with the enemies as they generate a large set of harmful weapons.Therefore its race of survival against the enemies and one should stand for his own country and for the safety of the country.Now a days the people are becoming so selfish that they only thought about there safety and not about the safety of the country they fight for ownself and are not united.The establishment of these nuclear powers made the country strong and unaffected by the revenges taken by the other countries.Now country is also having a bunch of weapons which destroy the whole area in a minute or a second .As the enemies are increasing it should be necessary to increases the deployment of arms and weapons because without these one will become handicaped on the side of power.Therefore these earms help are country to fight against there reveleries.Therefore the development of nuclear items is dangerous as well as benefiacial for the growth of country because as the youth changes there trends accordings to the seasons as similar the country should be change for its further growth and progress.",2.5
1237,5,5_421,"In an era where every second person hopes and works towards achieving world peace, an arms race is just a set back. Since time immemorial we have seen the costs and consequences that humankind, and the world as a whole, had to pay due to the ravages of war. We keep hearing about the various nuclear experiments carried out by the superpowers in their process of building weapons, that will only bring destruction, but according to them it is a source of power. To give a few examples of the cons of this endless arms race I will venture back to 1945 - the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Were these attacks necessary? As a student of Political Science I can give you an answer - it was not. To prove to the Soviet Union, the second Superpower, that they were &bigger and better& the United States decided to bomb these Japanese cities in the name of ending the World War II. The WW did end but with it started a war towards humankind, destroying the lives of so many innocent people. What use are the nuclear wepons of if they are made by humans to attack their fellow humans only? After the WW we did not achieve the desired peace as the Cold War started which saw the rise in accumulation of nuclear arsenal and the threat of another war prevailed. The policy of deterrance was followed which prevented the two Superpowers from going to war with each other but the proxy war taking place all ovver the world was much disastrous as is harmed people who were fighting someone elses war. There are no pros which can speak for this arms race, unless of course we are under direct threat from the extra terretrial entities and we need to save our world. But until that is happening there is no need of it. A country might think that they can win over the world by the wepons they have and by destroying other countries but if you have already destroyed the other country then what is the point of capturing it? Why not, instead of building the nuclear arsenal, do these Superpowers work towards building the human arsenal by educating the illiterate, by providing jobs to the unemployed, and by looking after the ones in need? Why can these countries not work together to empower everyone to make themselves great in the truest of sense? Stop the arms race because it is harmful to everyoen and everything - the humans and our nature. We have so many problems that are threatening our existence - that of human rights, education, climate change and, to top it all, terrorism. We already have a handful of people who want to watch the world burn. Let&s not give in to them by fulfilling their desires. Let us all work towards solving these problems. Stop the arms race and start a race which makes more sense like that of being the most developed country in terms of education and happiness of it citizens. That is what matters and that is what we should work towards for and look after. And that will make the whole wor",4.0
1238,5,5_422,"INTRODUCTION :Since the beginning of the time of the human kind, arms have been the part and parcel of human way of life. At the dawn of the simplest forms of civilisation humans were hunters, thats where arms in the simplets forms came into being. As time proceeded these arms were used to protect property,area of residence,women,children,the elders either from animal attacks or attacks from other groups of people.COLONISATION ANDARMS :Humans started living in different parts of the world, and according to their regions of living their civilisations were also altered. It is seen that most of the adavnced and bigger civilisation grew up in the valleys of huge river bodies around different continenets for example The Indus Valley Civilisation, Mespotomian, The Egyptian, The Greek,The Chinese civilisation and others. With modernisation of ways of life, ways of self-defencealso changed. According to mythologypeople were capable of using weapons of mass destruction such as the Brahmastra and Pashupatastra even then. However solid proof is present. The biggest change came that came into the weapons race was with invention of fire arms and guns. Towards the late 18th century most of the European countries started colonies all around the world only because of theiradavanced fire arms.EXPANSIONISM OF EUROPEAN SUPER-POWERS AND THE WWI & WWII :At the dawn of the 20th century there had been numerous brawls over the colonies of the European super-powers and there had been number of countries who few others as allies and others as threats. By this time the United States of America was also born and it was an emerging superpower. All these reasons lead to rise to 1st World War took place, where age old enemies turned allies and friends becames foes.Within 20 years of the defeat of the Axis power the world got involved into the 2nd World War. Many eminent personalities held the flames of the war like Hitler,Mussoulini,Churchil,Roosevelt,Lenin and others. The world saw the biggest massacre of human lives with dropping of Atom Bombs in Japan to terminate the war. Since then the real race started.THE COLD WAR & CURRENT SCENARIO :The cold war was a threatening process between USA AND USSR that never actually became a war but gave birth to new states with nuclear powers.In the present world most ofthe countries are equipped with n nuclear power. India,USA,USSR,North Korea,Pakistan and a lot others have tonnes of nuclear arms in their arsenal. it is most probable the next war is going to start between India and Pakistan and other Islamic nations mostly and later joined by the other super powers. CONCLUSIONThere is'nt much of pros in this except for the security of the citizens ,however there is'nt much hope of survival of human kind of such a war is fought with Nuclear arms. As predicted by Nostradamus the man with the blue turban from middle eastwill attack the new city ( New York ) that will trigger world annhilation.",3.0
1239,5,5_423,"""To conquer a nation, first disarm its citizens"" - Adolf Hitler. The fight was,is, and will be of and about the intellect amongst the human race. The mere division of demographics does not constitute peace and harmony in the share of natural resources for the race across the world. Long time abuse of power and domination has paved the way for nuclear posession in the context of its usage for war. A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that goes off because of nuclear reactions-fission and fusion. These energies causes an explosion. Japan beared destructive display of this technology in world war-II. The race is to protect one&s homeland from the domination and selfish acquisition in the name of survival. It is widely said that the next war will be a nuclear, impending over many countries, to watch out their act. Humans have always protected their dignity when it comes to family,friends or nation as one battle and this is the need of the hour. Terrorism has turned its face on all of us, our neighbours are lining up across the borders to threaten our capabilities. But not every action is legit. Serious impending implications are unheard by the decision-makers leading to an imbalanced communal repercussion. There are several cons to be the king in the making via this technology. Half of the nations equipped with such weapons rely on these for their strategic defense. the bombs are kept ready to activate as and when went against. Morals have taken a beating. there are no more lawful nations in sovereign world we call it as. high maintenance cost burns the tax-payers pocket unnecessarily waiting for a one time thing. North korea is the prime example. a nation everybody fears for they sit on their wealthy investment, focussed production on more such weapons adn harsh communal politics. Emerging one might be China. Residual radiaiton threatens the eco-system. Bhopal gas tragedy is a perfect example of &Who pays at the end&?The self-obsessed triggers have caused this need. Power consumes everyone and the fight to lack of resources is the thrill. This abundant production of weapons adn deployment of armies causes a fiscal deficit in many countries but is the surprise of cannabilism atmosphere the world is sulking in. Atleast it is giving power to the less owned states, countries against the world-wide dominance of first world nations. Such strategies are helping many as a key deterrent to major wars that worked as an undercurrent sentiment or the cost of getting diplomatic talks in favor before. Nomore they are pitied people asking like a beggar. no one wants conflict in this era of ever changing developments and hidden nationwide preparation against each global step. power supply crisis has been thr biggest boon for nations like India,if rightfully used it is bliss. The number of nations that have the resources and ability to create nuclear weapons is remarkably higher than the ones who already own these weapons. Every nation should have some of these weapons to avoid the combative probability of a group on earth posessing these against all. then.As perfectly quoted by s",4.5
